      January is National Oatmeal Month &mdash; appropriate since more oatmeal is eaten this month than at any other time of year. This whole-grain goodie, packed with nutrients and fiber, is available in various forms:
      
      * **Rolled.** This is the type of oatmeal most commonly found in grocery stores. It&rsquo;s made by steaming whole oats and pressing them flat between rollers. Rolled oats are further processed into &ldquo;old fashioned&rdquo; thin flakes, &ldquo;quick&rdquo; small pieces that cook faster, or &ldquo;instant,&rdquo; which are precooked.
      
      * **Groats.** Oat groats are the whole kernels as they&rsquo;re harvested. They have the highest nutrition value of all oat types and are quite filling, but they take up to an hour to cook.
      
      * **Steel-cut.** Also known as Irish oatmeal, steel-cut oats are groats cut into smaller pieces. This shortens the cooking time, but keeps all the nutrition value of the whole grain. 
      
      * **Scottish.** Not to be confused with Irish oatmeal, Scottish oats are steamed, steel-cut oats ground into a meal to allow a shorter cooking time. Some manufacturers toast the oats to create a richer flavor.

      Is walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week part of your New Year&rsquo;s resolution? Here are some tips for success when either starting or continuing a consistent walking routine:
      
      * **Make it social.** Invite a friend or family member to join you. You can also connect with your Sole Mates either in person or virtually using KP Walk!. 
      
      * **Break up the year.** Look at the months ahead as 12 opportunities rather than a span of time. Set goals that include fun incentives, like participating in a charity walk or taking longer hikes one weekend each month. Or assign themes to each month like Green Walking Month, when you vow to incorporate walking into your commute one day a week. 
      
      * **Keep it interesting.** Consider changing when and where you walk. Look up trails you&rsquo;d like to explore and set a date to hike them. Or take a new friend with you on your walk. 
      
      The New Year prompts new commitments &mdash; be sure to make walking one of them.

      Keeping new year&rsquo;s resolutions can be challenging. Committing to new, healthy behaviors is easier if you understand the stages of change you may go through.
      
      * **Stage 1: Precontemplation.** The precontemplative individual has no plans to start exercising or eat more healthfully. Learning about the benefits of making healthy choices can inspire him or her to start.
      
      * **Stage 2: Contemplation.** Individuals contemplating change may have realized the benefits of change, but need a push to get going. It will help them to understand that physical activity can be enjoyable and eating well can be delicious and easy.
      
      * **Stage 3: Preparation.** At this stage, people are ready to make changes to their schedule or habits. They need an action plan for exercising and ideas for healthy meals. They also need a backup plan for what to do when their schedule is interrupted or motivation is low. 
      
      * **Stage 4: Action.** These folks have started exercising and revamped their menu, but the changes are not yet ingrained habits. Reminders and rewards for achievements can help maintain momentum.
      
      * **Stage 5: Maintenance.** At this stage, people have been exercising and eating nutritiously for several months, and the new behavior has become part of their lifestyle. They can prevent relapse by tracking their success and setting new goals.
      
      Throughout all the stages, support from family and friends is beneficial.
      
      Knowing your health status is one of the most important steps you can take to understanding your health. You can take the [Total Health Assessment](http://my.kp.org/healthworks/hwf/healthyworkforce/rewards.html) (THA) online questionnaire to see how you&rsquo;re doing overall. The Total Health Assessment is a quick and easy online tool that in just 20-30 minutes creates a health action plan just for you.

      * **Watch your portions.** According to the [free radical theory](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2684512/), excess calories over a lifetime reduce longevity thanks to cellular breakdown that occurs when food is metabolized. That&rsquo;s why portion control can keep your waistline slim, your heart in check, and your disease risk down.

      \r\n\
      * **Paint your plate.** The [USDA guidelines](http://www.choosemyplate.gov) suggest filling half your dish with fruits and vegetables at every meal, aiming for a rainbow of colors. [Studies](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/vegetables-full-story) indicate that a variety of produce pigments is the true spice of life. \r\n\

Research finds that physical activity is a [fundamental](http://aspe.hhs.gov/health/reports/physicalactivity) of good physical and mental health. And walking at least 30 minutes a day, five days a week can meet your needs and help you feel your best.   \r\n\

      Does walking in a winter wonderland send shivers up your spine? While you have to prepare for walking in cold weather to stay at a good temperature, a walk in the brisk, winter air can work wonders on your body and your spirits. Heed these tips for staying warm as you walk 30 minutes a day, five days a week. 
      
      * **Layer your attire.** Exercise naturally heats up your body, causing you to sweat. But as perspiration cools, it can give you a chill. So start with a bottom layer, followed with a jacket for insulation. Guard against the elements with a waterproof, breathable outer layer like a windbreaker. 
      
      * **Use warming accessories.** Wear a hat and scarf to keep your face and head toasty, and ear muffs to warm your ears. Remember gloves or mittens to protect your hands, which &mdash; along with your feet &mdash; are most susceptible to chill. Consider purchasing shoes a half size bigger for your winter walks so you can wear thick thermal socks. 
      
      * **Take it indoors.** If it is truly too cold to walk outdoors, take your walk inside. Try 30 minutes on a treadmill. Or take your routine to the mall and walk the halls. 
      
      Embrace Jack Frost as you prepare for a walk in the cold. The brisk air will feel good, and the walk will ultimately make you feel great.  Be sure to find time for your walk today.

      Fruits and vegetables are healthful, low-calorie options all year-round. But during winter many of your favorites may not be available, or are pricey when you can find them. Next time you&rsquo;re shopping, challenge yourself to [try something new](http://thrive.kp.org/thrive/cooking-eating/index.php) &mdash; enjoy these winter fruits and vegetables:
      
      * **Moro oranges.** An excellent source of vitamin C and fiber, Moro oranges are also known as blood oranges because of their red pulp. Their orange flavor is punctuated with a hint of raspberry. Enjoy them as is, toss sections in a salad, or use the juice as a marinade for chicken or fish.
      
      * **Cherimoyas.** This tasty fruit has a creamy white flesh that&rsquo;s delicious sliced or in a smoothie. They may look strange but the taste is divine &mdash; tart and fruity with a twist of vanilla. Cherimoyas are rich in fiber, vitamin C, and calcium.
      
      * **Delicata squash.** This small, oblong squash is packed with nutrition &mdash; vitamins A and C, potassium, fiber, manganese, and folate. Just split lengthwise, remove the seeds, and pierce in several places; bake with the hollow side up, then enjoy sliced or stuffed.
      
      * **Rutabagas.** This versatile root vegetable is a savory addition to soups and stews. Rutabagas can also be boiled or baked and mashed as a hearty side dish similar to mashed potatoes. They&rsquo;re a good source of vitamins A and C, and contain indoles &mdash; phytochemicals that protect the body against certain cancers.
      
      * **Swiss chard.** The stalks taste a bit like celery, and the leaves are often used in place of spinach. Include Swiss chard in your salad, or cook and serve with a dash of wine and balsamic vinegar plus a handful of raisins.

      &ldquo;Some of the best lunches at work are the ones you can spend walking with your friends. It&rsquo;s a great way to spend 45 minutes of your day &mdash; laughing, walking, and breathing fresh air,&rdquo; says Jacqueline Diaz, Receptionist, Northern California Region. 
      
      There are many benefits to walking with a friend or family member. Or, if you have a new friend or colleague you&rsquo;d like to get to know better, inviting them to walk is an excellent opportunity to do so. Before you get started on a consistent walking routine, first agree on these basics with your walking partners:
      
      * **Accountability.** Counting on each other deepens commitment, so plan your treks at times and places that work for everyone.
      
      * **Pace.** Walking with someone who has a faster clip can challenge your stride, yet the gap can be a burden to both. Understand the speed expectation and stick to it &mdash; if the pace gets uncomfortable, speak up.
      
      * **Conversation.** If you like to talk, make sure your partner&rsquo;s on board &mdash; he or she may prefer less chit-chat. 
      
      Walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week with a pal can boost both your dedication and performance. Remember, KP Walk! also provides opportunities to network with your KP colleagues through Sole Mates or Walking Wall.

      If you turned up your nose at Brussels sprouts when you were a kid, it might be time to try them again. Tied with broccoli for providing the most folic acid and ranking first for the most vitamin E and omega-3 fatty acids of all cruciferous veggies, Brussels sprouts are captains of cardiovascular health and cancer prevention. In fact, they contain phytochemicals that actually protect against DNA damage. But these nutritional stars don&rsquo;t always get a lot of culinary air time thanks to their reputation for being bitter. [Studies](http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/begin/traits/ptc) suggest humans have a genetic disposition toward either loving or hating their bold taste. Fortunately, you can learn to savor their flavor with some cooking tricks: 
      
      * Stir-fry Brussels sprouts, sesame oil, soy sauce, onions, and ginger &mdash; flavors which tone down their bitterness and make for a sweet and salty Asian dish.
      
      * Cook them with chicken stock, garlic, lemon juice, and onions to neutralize their pungent punch and highlight their natural zest. 
      
      * Mix steamed sprouts with cranberries, nutmeg, a dash of salt, and walnuts for a nutty, sweet spin.

      [Experts][1] recommend developing sleep routines for infants and children, but rituals for hitting the hay at the same time are just as important for grown-ups. Lull yourself into a more peaceful slumber with these tips:

      Experts recommend developing sleep routines for infants and children, but rituals for hitting the hay at the same time are just as important for grown-ups. Lull yourself into a more peaceful slumber with these tips:
      
      - **Set a time.** Follow the example of camps and barracks -- establish a lights-out hour and let the clock have the final say. 
      
      - **Pick three.** Decide three simple practices you can do about an hour to 20 minutes before bed to ease your body and brain into sleep mode -- a warm bath; short meditations or prayers; stretches or breathing exercises. Hint: Avoid reading page turners -- the goal is to help you get some shut-eye, not keep you from it. 
      
      - **Switch to off.** Scrolling, typing, texting, and surfing... the digital chaos can keep you up. Commit to turning off the technology at least an hour before turning in so you can train your mind to power down too. 
      
      Given that most adults experience some kind of snooze deficit, it's safe to say we could all use a little nudge into dreamland.

      Gloomy days and early nights challenge winter walkers to remain visible on paths and roadways. Pedestrians &mdash; especially when dressed in dark clothing &mdash; can be missed even by careful drivers. Brighten your look and increase your safety with a few alterations to your workout wear.
      
      * **Get reflective.** Replace worn walking clothes and shoes with light-reflecting gear. For maximum value, buy pieces touting 360-degree visibility so you can be easily seen from all angles. For an inexpensive alternative, apply a few strips of reflective tape to the front, back, and sides of your clothing. Consider investing in at least one large reflective outer layer &mdash; for example, an all-weather vest that can be worn year-round &mdash; to prompt drivers to pay close attention. 
      
      * **Light your way.** Wearing a headlamp or strobe light clipped to your clothes keeps hands free and brightly signals your presence in poorly lit areas. 
      
      * **Take caution.** Stick to dedicated walking paths and sidewalks. For unavoidable roadways, stay left to face oncoming traffic and keep potential hazards in clear view. At crosswalks, wait for drivers to come to a full stop or make eye contact, especially if they&rsquo;re turning right. Otherwise, assume they can&rsquo;t see you, and pause until they&rsquo;ve passed.

      Does the thought of General Tso&rsquo;s chicken make your mouth water? Regardless, you may want to think twice. While many Asian dishes are healthy when prepared authentically &mdash; cooked with lots of vegetables and minimal oil &mdash; unfortunately, many Americanized Asian restaurants feature high-fat, high-calorie fare. You can still enjoy a guilt-free Asian meal, however, by following these tips:
      
      * **Choose appropriate appetizers.** Start with a low-calorie broth-based soup instead of deep-fried items. 
      
      * **Take note of preparation.** Pick entrees that are steamed, grilled, roasted, or broiled. Avoid those that are fried (including rice), battered, or prepared with heavy sauces &mdash; they&rsquo;re high in calories and artery-clogging fats. 
      
      * **Go for veggies.** Choose steamed or stir-fried vegetable side dishes. 
      
      * **Mind your portions.** Even if you select a healthy option, it&rsquo;s easy to get too many calories with the typical over-sized restaurant portions. Ask for a take-out container when your meal arrives and save half your portion for later. Or share one entree between two people.
      
      * **Watch the salt.** Chinese food is notoriously high in sodium. Choose low-sodium options and reduce your salt intake during the day if you plan to eat out.
      
      * **Enjoy tea with your meal.** It&rsquo;s a [powerful antioxidant](http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/green-tea-000255.htm) and virtually calorie-free.

      &ldquo;I have recruited my daughter and sister to be my exercise accountability partners. We are keeping each other motivated,&rdquo; says Terrie Rill, Senior Director of Nursing Services, Float Pool, Appointment and Advice Call Center, Colorado Region. 
      
      *As long as I get out for a 30-minute walk, does it matter if I&rsquo;m a couch potato all day? What if work is busy all week and I have to skip all my walks?* Inactivity physiology &mdash; the science of sitting &mdash; is a relatively new area of study, but it&rsquo;s coming up with surprising answers to questions like these.
      
      A growing body of data suggests that engaging in regular exercise and avoiding sedentary activity are distinctly separate behaviors. The benefits of regular exercise are well known &mdash; but the risks of sitting too much are only starting to be understood.  Prolonged bouts of sitting are strongly linked to diabetes, metabolic syndrome, heart disease risk, obesity, and other problems &mdash; independent of time spent on exercise.
      
      * A study of people who lost weight and kept it off found that successful weight maintenance was tied to not watching TV, regardless of the self-reported level of moderate to vigorous activity or other types of exercise. 
      
      * Not walking for a week is about as harmful to your health as smoking a pack of cigarettes, according to a New England Journal of Medicine report. 
      
      * [Taking frequent breaks from sitting](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/31/4/661.abstract) &mdash; such as walking a few steps or standing &mdash; is linked with improvements in waist circumference, body mass index, triglycerides, and blood glucose.

      &ldquo;I always ask my coworkers if they bring fruits for their snack. And always remind them to drink water and offer to get them more every time I go refill my water bottle,&rdquo; Jovelyn McKinney, Medical Assistant, Northwest Region.
      
      Many people don&rsquo;t realize that sodas, energy drinks, specialty coffee, or alcohol can add hundreds of [empty calories](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health/poc?uri=center:nutrition&article=A623FF24-6F89-11E0-BDA6-C775107BA6DE) and almost no nutritional value to your diet. Your best bet for healthy hydration is water.
      
      
      Calorie-free and refreshing, water plays an important role in regulating body temperature, removing waste, cushioning joints, and protecting your tissues and organs. Make drinking water throughout the day a habit:
      
      * Keep a reusable water bottle with you at all times &mdash; in the car, at your desk, on your walks, and in your gym bag.
      
      * Try out different calorie-free, caffeine-free bottled waters to mix it up &mdash; and choose sparkling varieties for some added pizzazz. 
      
      * Drink liquid with every meal and snack.
      
      * Remember to have water before and after your workout &mdash; during, too, if it&rsquo;s hot or dry outside.
      
      If water bores your taste buds, add a hint of flavor to give your mouth the incentive to drink up.  Add citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruit, or tangerines to your glass. Or crush fresh mint leaves for a fresher twist. Whether you jazz it up or drink it straight, getting enough water will keep you at performing at your peak.

      Lifting heavy weights isn&rsquo;t the only way to strengthen and define. Stimulating small fibers can help stabilize and support larger muscle groups, plus isometric holds and localized resistance training can help rehabilitate injured regions and promote better overall balance. Consider these techniques:
      
      * **Foot work.** Strengthening foot muscles and ligaments can help support the impact of daily life &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s preventing stress-related injuries or catching a wobbly step off the curb. Try standing on one foot and balancing for 30 seconds, then switch sides. Picking up small objects like a washcloth or marble with your toes can also build control and strength in your arches. 
      
      * **Sound middle.** Strengthening your abdominal muscles encourages good posture and reduces back strain. Try holding a [push-up plank](http://www.acefitness.org/exerciselibrary/32/front-plank) position for 30 seconds, eventually working up to a minute. Concentrate on pulling in your stomach when you drive or sit at your desk to help engage the muscles while you&rsquo;re at rest.
      
      Building and maintaining strength enables you to do the things you enjoy and perform everyday activities with less effort.

      Wearing properly insulated headgear to combat prolonged exposure to chilly outdoor temps is essential. Shielding the sensitive skin of your head, face, and neck prevents skin damage and makes your whole body feel warmer. Face winter in comfort and confidence by choosing the right protection for your climate and taste.
      
      * **Hats or hoods.** Thermal fleece or woolen hats shield your scalp from heat loss and easily stash away when not needed. When it&rsquo;s frigid, a ski mask that exposes only your eyes helps halt skin damage. 
      
      * **Scarves, gaiters, or buffs.** A traditional scarf warms your neck and can be draped down the torso for extra layering. Gaiters of wool, fleece, or fur are hollow tubes that slip around your neck to seal in warmth. Like gaiters, buffs are tubes, but made from breathable polyester microfiber with [multipurpose functions](http://www.buffusa.com/wear/how_to_wear_a_buff_video). Buffs are appealingly versatile, but if you routinely walk in freezing weather, a gaiter or scarf offers more insulation.
      
      * **Sunscreen, lip balm, and sunglasses.** Whatever your typical winter climate, the Skin Cancer Foundation recommends carefully selecting [sunscreen and lip balm](http://www.skincancer.org/seal/) to protect exposed skin. Likewise, wearing [ultraviolet light-blocking sunglasses](http://www.skincancer.org/best-defense.html) shields sensitive eyes from long-term damage.

      People don&rsquo;t overeat just because they&rsquo;re hungry &mdash; sometimes it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re not focused on the act of eating itself. Instead of savoring each bite, they unconsciously scarf down their food while reading, driving, or watching television. Eating mindfully means being fully engaged in your meal. Learn to slow down with these tips:
      
      * **Breathe.** Practice relaxation breathing before beginning your meal. 
      
      * **Ponder.** Think about how your food got to your table, including all the hard work and planning involved. Contemplate how your meal will nourish your body and provide energy throughout the day.
      
      * **Take small bites.** Taste the flavors &mdash; sweet, savory, salty. Enjoy the textures &mdash; smooth, chewy, crunchy. Fully experience each bite before swallowing. Recognize your hunger signals. When they begin to fade, stop eating.
      
      * **Beware.** Avoid [mindless eating pitfalls](http://www.todaysdietitian.com/newarchives/121610p30.shtml) and skip the junk food altogether.
      
      Mindful eating will make you more aware of what and how much you&rsquo;re eating and turn each meal into a truly nourishing experience. 
      
      Incorporate these elements into your daily diet and reap the many health benefits. Knowing your numbers, such as [cholesterol](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health/care/!ut/p/c4/FctNCoAgEEDhs3QAGfqDaNcpynbDODSCjhKSdPuSt_vgwQl_io-_sPikGOAAS0kLa1mFMRQxrPRSSJmdR9jbkG-8IoLVZAhJuJlU78BK7ft5GgfIMS5167oPXYJ2JA!!/), [blood pressure](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health/care/!ut/p/c4/FctBCoAgEEDRs3QAGWiR0q5TlO2GaXAEHSUk6fYlf_fgwwl_ik8M2GJRTHCAp6KNta3CmJoYVnoplcpXRNjHUG8MGcFrMYQkPEx6vMBLX2brLNScXd-m6QPPoplb/), and [BMI](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health/care/!ut/p/c4/LcxRCoMwEATQE8kSbWn0Bp6gTf-WdTGBZBPapdrb65YyX_NgBp5wRvCTVtRUBTM8IFAVZdEpMmaNHQt9KdfGS0K426C9cC0IQWpHSJHNfqNd5wUCouv70V2N30x2bKz7ZfDOMG7p328jtFL8UPx2AFdFsgY!/), is also a key to good health.

    str: "People don't overeat just because they're hungry \xE2\x80\x94 sometimes it's because they're not focused on the act of eating itself. Instead of savoring each bite, they unconsciously scarf down their food while reading, driving, or watching television. Eating mindfully means being fully engaged in your meal. Learn to slow down with these tips:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      * **Breathe.** Practice relaxation breathing before beginning your meal. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      * **Ponder.** Think about how your food got to your table, including all the hard work and planning involved. Contemplate how your meal will nourish your body and provide energy throughout the day.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      * **Take small bites.** Taste the flavors \xE2\x80\x94 sweet, savory, salty. Enjoy the textures \xE2\x80\x94 smooth, chewy, crunchy. Fully experience each bite before swallowing. Recognize your hunger signals. When they begin to fade, stop eating.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      * **Beware.** Avoid mindless eating pitfalls and skip the junk food altogether.\r\n\
      Mindful eating will make you more aware of what and how much you're eating and turn each meal into a truly nourishing experience. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      Incorporate these elements into your daily diet and reap the many health benefits. Knowing your numbers, such as cholesterol, blood pressure, and BMI, is also a key to good health.

      The weekend&rsquo;s perfect for a cross-country walk &mdash; but to truly savor winter&rsquo;s snowy, peaceful beauty, learn the simple skill of snowshoeing. Snowshoes distribute weight evenly over large soles, enabling walkers to &ldquo;float&rdquo; over otherwise impassibly deep mounds of snow. Plan an exciting snowshoe adventure with basic tips and tools to get you on your feet fast.
      
      * **Scout national parks.** To encourage winter exploration, many [U.S. national parks](http://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/10great/2010-01-07-winter-trails-day_N.htm) offer free snowshoe classes and guided tours. Snowshoers also enjoy uncrowded vistas and sharply discounted off-season hotel rates. Surf online for nearby parks and class/tour options.
      
      * **Gear up.** Some park tours provide free snowshoes, but if you need your own, many outdoor gear retailers can provide a wealth of online information about choosing the right pair. Snowshoe selection depends on your gender and weight, and whether your chosen terrain is flat or hilly, covered in powder, or steeped in wet, clinging snow. REI also provides tips on selecting boots, poles, and other essential snowshoeing accessories.
      
      * **Learn by example.** Look for online tutorials for beginning snowshoers. Start with flat terrain for fast progress, and always take a buddy for support.

      Red, white, and blue, heirloom or new &mdash; which potato is your favorite? Although most grocers carry only a few types, more than 4,000 varieties exist, each with different culinary attributes. These are the most popular:
      
      * **Russet.** Also called baking potatoes, russet potatoes are brown-colored, low in moisture, and high in starch. Ideal for baking, mashing, or frying, they cook up relatively dry, fluffy, and delicious.
      
      * **White.** With skin color ranging from ivory to pale gray, white potatoes are moister than russets and lower in starch content. They hold up well when boiled. 
      
      * **Red.** Red potatoes have a dense, crisp texture. Slices and chunks retain their shape during cooking, making them excellent for salads, saut&#233;s, and stews. 
      
      * **Yellow.** With golden flesh and a creamy texture, yellow potatoes are delicious roasted, grilled, or steamed.
      
      * **Blue and purple.** Prized for their deep hues inside and out, these heirloom spuds have a delicate, but familiar flavor. They are tasty &mdash; and have a pleasing appearance &mdash; in a variety of recipes.
      
      * **Sweet potatoes and yams.** Roots of a vine found in the morning glory family, sweet potatoes are elongated in shape with tapered ends. Yams are large (up to seven feet) tubers of tropical vines. The sweet potato is typically sweeter and softer to the palate. Both are delicious baked, steamed, mashed, or simply cooked in the microwave.

      Nothing like a bowl of steaming soup to take the chill out. But not all broths are the same: 
      
      * Stick with thin or vegetable-based reduced sodium broths like classic chicken noodle or tomato. [Studies](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/10/001018075252.htm) support the claim that chicken soup can soothe your cold, while tomato&rsquo;s cancer-fighting lycopene is activated when cooked and mashed. 
      
      * Explore ethnic varieties like miso soup or minestrone, which are loaded with veggies and legumes. Made from a fermented soybean paste, miso can give a flavor burst to boiling water while serving as an excellent source of protein, immune-supporting zinc, and tryptophan &mdash; an essential amino acid that helps balance mood and aid sleep.
      
      * Go with homemade over canned or packets, which can be high in salt, MSG, and other preservatives. For silky textures, try using pur&#233;ed squash instead of cream. And don&rsquo;t forget about chili. Packed with fiber- and protein-rich beans, spices, and tomato paste, it&rsquo;s a healthy meal on any day. For a leaner approach, go with ground turkey over beef or nix the meat altogether for a vegetarian dish.
      
      Know which soup to serve for a nourishing meal.

      &ldquo;Keep in mind the little things we do make a difference &mdash; taking the stairs instead of the elevators, finding time to squeeze in a 15-minute walk during lunch, eating light, and getting out of the mindset that you&rsquo;re too tired to work out. Make it a great day!&rdquo; says Tiyuona Richardson, Senior Medical Assistant, Northern California Region. 
      
      Looking for an easy way to brighten your mood? Get off your chair and out the door &mdash;even a 10-minute walk can immediately boost your energy, raise your spirits, and promote a sense of well-being all day long.
      
      Besides being a great way to stay fit and feel your best every day, regular walking is often used as a form of treatment for mild anxiety or depression and panic attacks. Exercise fosters brain cell development, produces chemical changes in the brain that have a calming effect, and relieves muscle tension that can fuel stress. It also offers a healthy distraction and builds physical as well as psychological resilience. 
      
      * Walking increases the production of natural mood elevators called endorphins &mdash; the &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; hormones that calm the brain and relieve muscle discomfort as you exercise. 
      
      * It also increases dopamine, a hormone that cultivates feelings of wellness and motivation, improves mood, and increases your brain&rsquo;s ability to pay attention. 
      
      * A daily walk increases your levels of serotonin &mdash; a hormone that regulates mood and impulse control, and helps you feel good about yourself.
      
      * [One study](http://www.endalldisease.com/study-exercise-is-natures-best-antidepressant-medicine/) shows that every 50 minutes of weekly exercise is linked to a 50 percent drop in the risk of depression.
      
      A single bout of exercise can elevate mood for up to 12 hours.

      Got the munchies? If you&rsquo;re a late-night snacker, you&rsquo;re not alone. In the evening, many people watch TV, play video games, or surf the Web to relax. Unfortunately, these activities often get paired with mindless snacking &mdash; and before you know it, a whole box of Girl Scout cookies is gone.
      
      Snacking can be a [good thing](https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health/care/!ut/p/c5/dYxdcoIwGEXX4gKcL2EGhMeAmIi1iLQS8sIQx6H8JZZQka6-uIDe83IezlwQsKDKR12VY61V2QEH4RS7KI19HxNEKduhPdtSfMDUQq4DGaQ3VXymi4hXiv4ZQRCBqDotl9Ps62o2gSZTSDgxuG47gsuASctTjtNu572hz4BH_Mp7rzqho5SXEDduXjr2UZ-JafWB5OmvUZtnjZJxGO5-YcZYns5Nk1lh5HpimqcfthZqjpPYXNbfbKhjV8xegt6m0MY5WcE70_0N7r37YT_I6g9B782s/dl3/d3/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/) &mdash; but use caution if you&rsquo;re reaching for treats at night.
      
      * **Get some shut-eye.** When your body tells you it&rsquo;s time for sleep, do you head for your bedroom or the kitchen? It&rsquo;s easy to misinterpret your body&rsquo;s signals when you&rsquo;re tired. If you had a balanced dinner and you&rsquo;re really not hungry, just go to bed. (Late-night snacks can disrupt sleep patterns and reduce overall sleep quality.)
      
      * **Recognize hunger pangs.** If you didn&rsquo;t eat enough during the day, a sensible snack at night is fine. Combine protein with complex carbs for staying power. Have a cup of yogurt or a piece of string cheese and a half cup of fruit or vegetables &mdash; even a small bowl of low-sugar whole-grain cereal will do the trick. And be sure to eat a healthy, balanced, leisurely dinner &mdash; no later than three hours before bedtime.

      Does walking make a difference in your health if you have 20 or more pounds to lose? What if you&rsquo;re ready to start a walking program, but not ready to work on weight loss? With overweight and obesity rates continuing to climb, these are excellent questions.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      In a [renowned 12-year study](http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/298/21/2507.full.pdf+html) of older adults (average age 64), researchers found that fitness levels (as measured by treadmill test performance) were associated with lower death rates &mdash; across body fat percent readings.

But before dropping any item into your shopping cart, read the fine print on the product&rsquo;s [nutrition facts label](http://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/labelingnutrition/ucm20026097.htm). And while it&rsquo;s seemingly simple, these tips can help you read the label correctly:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      * **Look closely at serving size.** The amount of saturated fat, sugar, and sodium listed for each serving tells you very little without knowing the serving size and number of servings per package.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      * **Avoid lengthy ingredient lists.** Ingredient lists with one word, like broccoli, oatmeal, or apple, are considered whole foods and are usually very healthy. Don&rsquo;t choose items with long lists of artificial additives, hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils, or MSG. \r\n\
      \r\n\

    str: "Colorful packaging and slick advertising may catch your eye. But before dropping any item into your shopping cart, read the fine print on the product's nutrition facts label. And while it's seemingly simple, these tips can help you read the label correctly:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      * **Look closely at serving size.** The amount of saturated fat, sugar, and sodium listed for each serving tells you very little without knowing the serving size and number of servings per package.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      * **Avoid lengthy ingredient lists.** Ingredient lists with one word, like broccoli, oatmeal, or apple, are considered whole foods and are usually very healthy. Don't choose items with long lists of artificial additives, hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils, or MSG. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      * **Check out the percent daily values.** A single tablespoon of soy sauce can contain 1,300 milligrams of salt \xE2\x80\x94 over half of the recommended maximum daily sodium intake. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      Understand not only what a food contains but how it contributes to your total daily allotment of nutrients. \r\n"

      While most vegetation goes dormant in winter, some hardy plants hang on through the chill. 
      
      - **Broccoli:** A year-round favorite, broccoli is a nutrient-dense food &mdash; with a host of health-boosting antioxidants and immune-strengthening vitamins &mdash; you&rsquo;ll want to serve the cruciferous veggie at least three times a week. Stay warm with broccoli and mushroom soup or cut up florets into your salad to boost nutrition power.
      
      - **Oranges and tangerines:** These citrus favorites deliver a sweet dose of vitamin C &mdash; perfect for the cold and flu season. Spruce up your salad with the juicy tang of Clementine or Mandarin oranges. Throw a tangerine into your lunch. Or whip up an orange salsa using chopped oranges, tomato, cilantro, green onion, walnuts, and lime juice to top fish or chicken. For best quality, choose fruits that seem heavy for their size and have a relatively thin skin. 
      
      - **[Kale](http://www.fruitsandveggiesmorematters.org/kale):** Another super food, kale is a crisp, dark green plant that can be saut&eacute;ed with a little olive oil and garlic for a side dish or integrated into a variety of dishes like lasagna, enchiladas, stews, or soups. 
      
      Seasonal produce is often fresher and cheaper, so take advantage of winter&rsquo;s crops by enjoying fruits and veggies at their peak.

      &ldquo;As we travel along this journey, it sometimes seems as if we are not getting very far. Don&rsquo;t be discouraged &mdash; we are making great strides. I love walking. My mind feels stronger, my emotional side is better, and life looks brighter,&rdquo; says Eulease Yokum, Membership Administration, Colorado Region. 
      
      Staying committed to a walking routine is vital for your overall health even on days when your motivation is not at peak performance. Keep your momentum going to walk 30 minutes a day, five days a week with these tips: 
      
      - **Get inspired.** Solicit support from your Sole Mates and fellow KP colleagues on the Walking Wall or engage your family in your walking through [Every Body Walk!](http://everybodywalk.org/). Sharing your walking experiences with someone can rev up your enthusiasm, hold you accountable to your goals, and ignite your ability to achieve them.  
      
      - **Set a small objective.** Set a short-term, attainable goal, such as walking rather than driving for at least one errand tomorrow or scheduling a walking date this weekend with a friend. 
      
      - **Switch perspective.** Sometimes all you need is a little change of pace. Explore a new trail, try different music while you walk, or just move your walk to another time of day.
      
      Remember, walking is one of the simplest things you can do to achieve better health. If you don&rsquo;t have 30 minutes, you can break your time up into shorter walks and receive the same health benefits.

      The heart works tirelessly every day. Yet, many people don&rsquo;t think much about their heart health until something goes wrong. Unfortunately, that happens pretty often: Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States and a significant cause of disability. 
      
      The good news is that your risk of heart disease can be reduced by making healthy lifestyle changes. American Heart Month (February) is a great time to focus on making changes to lower your risk: 
      
      - Choose baked or broiled fish, lean meats, poultry without the skin, or beans as your main sources of protein. 
      
      - Eat a colorful array of fruits and vegetables daily. 
      
      - Add whole grains to your diet &mdash; they&rsquo;re naturally low in fat and high in fiber. 
      
      - Switch to heart-healthy oils such as olive, canola, or safflower oil &mdash; and use less hydrogenated or saturated types. 
      
      - Choose foods that are low in fat, sugar, sodium, and colesterol.
      
      - Watch your calories. Excess weight, especially around your waist, increases your risk of high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke.
      
      - Stay active. Aim for 30 minutes a day, five days a week, of any heart-pumping activity you enjoy. Try walking, running, bicycling, swimming, dancing, or team sports.  
      
      In addition to making these healthy choices, knowing your health status is one of the most important steps you can take to understanding your health and keeping your heart strong. You can take the [Total Health Assessment](http://my.kp.org/healthworks/hwf/healthyworkforce/rewards.html) (THA) online questionnaire to see how you&rsquo;re doing overall. The Total Health Assessment is a quick and easy online tool that in just 20-30 minutes creates a health action plan just for you.

    str: "It&rsquo;s common wisdom that dressing in layers keeps you warm in winter. Just as important is how you layer &mdash; and selecting the correct materials is crucial.  Maximize your cold weather wear&rsquo;s versatility and effectiveness with proven layering principles:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Block moisture at the base.** A base layer against your skin stops perspiration from causing painful chills. Ideal base fabrics are lightweight, breathable, and made from materials that lift moisture off skin. Merino wool, silk, and synthetic fibers touted as &ldquo;moisture-wicking&rdquo; are sensible base layer choices. For freezing temps, consider thermal underwear as a base.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Insulate the middle.** A middle layer traps body heat, protecting your core from cold air. For wet conditions, try a jacket or vest made from moisture-resistant material like merino wool or fleece. If your typical walk is cold and windy, seek products tagged as &ldquo;wind fleece&rdquo; that are sewn with an extra membrane to block drafts. In dryer climates, lightweight goose down pieces offer exceptional warmth, and can be easily stripped and stashed away if you get overheated. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Shield with a shell.** An outer layer shields you from the elements, so tailor it to your area&rsquo;s typical winter weather. For the best fit, shop for shells while wearing base and middle layers. Frequent rain or snow calls for shells made from a waterproof yet breathable fabric. In milder climates, water-resistant nylon effectively blocks wind and light rain. Increasingly popular among budget-conscious shoppers, soft shells come in cold and mild weather weights, eliminating middle layers by combining insulation with weather protection. "

      Oranges are the most popular citrus fruit &mdash; enjoyed on their own as tart treats, or as a sweet accent in a variety of both hot and cold dishes. Beyond their flexible flavor, oranges also offer a host of nutritional benefits. Studies show that the flavonoids in citrus fruit are [anti-inflammatory superstars](http://www.buffalo.edu/news/8756) that protect against cell-damaging oxidization. This is especially helpful for those with diabetes and others who are at higher risk of heart disease. Whether you prefer navel, Valencia, or blood oranges, peel one today and reap the health benefits.
      
      - Thanks to high concentrations of vitamin C and numerous other antioxidants, oranges help your immune system defend against everything from the common cold to stomach and colon cancer. Enjoy this immune-booster whole or in juice form. Go for fresh-squeezed over processed and keep as much pulp as possible for the highest nutritional advantage. Or, blend fresh orange juice with a little yogurt and freeze in ice cube trays for healthy popsicles.
      
      - [Preliminary studies](http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/np/fnrb/fnrb1005.htm#orange) suggest that compounds in orange peel can lower cholesterol more effectively than statin drugs. Try grating a well-scrubbed tangerine or orange into teas for a zesty flavor enhancer. Or sprinkle shavings over your salad, cereal, or yogurt.

      Not all cholesterol&rsquo;s bad. In fact, you want to eat foods that raise HDL (high density lipoprotein) &mdash; good cholesterol &mdash; in your bloodstream. 
      
      - Although meat, eggs, and dairy contain both cholesterol and saturated fats, foods with trans-fatty acids are a bigger threat. [Research](http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/fats-full-story) suggests that the body generates more LDL cholesterol to help usher the trans-fats into your system, mainly because your body wasn&rsquo;t naturally designed to handle the manufactured oils. So cut back on saturated fats, but be more diligent in avoiding processed and fried items with partially hydrogenated oils.
      
      - Eating oatmeal, nuts, and fatty fish can improve your HDL-to-LDL ratio. And just losing weight through increased exercise and portion control can change cholesterol levels &mdash; and your quality of life &mdash; for the better.

      Any walking you do is significant, and walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week can increase energy, tone muscles, and boost your immune system. In addition, walking can relieve stress, enhance mental agility, lift your mood, and reduce health risks, such as diabetes and heart disease. Find your 30 minutes to walk with the following ideas:
      
      - **Walk when you can:** If you need to drive or take public transportation, consider parking a couple blocks away or getting off a few stops ahead. Walk to a coworker&rsquo;s desk instead of sending an email. Or conduct a meeting as you take a few laps around the building.
      
      - **Use your lunch hour:** Take a quick walk before you eat. Do errands on foot. Or walk with coworkers to your favorite restaurant.
      
      - **Find the stairs:** Skip the elevator and take the stairs. You can get in a great cardio workout &mdash; and burn more calories per minute than most other forms of physical activity &mdash; without needing any special skills, equipment, or clothing.
      
      Get in your walking time whenever you can and take steps toward a healthier you.

      &ldquo;My dog is my motivation. She is 13 years old and still going. If she can do it, I can!&rdquo; says Paula Fahilga, Customer Services Representative, Northwest Region. 
      
      No matter where you live, weather swings can dampen your inspiration to get outdoors for a walk. Remain faithful to walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week with these hints:
      
      - **Clothing:** Layering is the key, especially in colder climates. Wear a hooded windproof, water-resistant outer layer, a micro-fleece pullover for a middle layer, and moisture-wicking leggings, tanks, or shirts next to your skin. Add a hat and gloves, if necessary. Light waterproof hiking shoes or boots will protect from the elements and provide traction. And don&rsquo;t forget sunglasses &mdash; even when it&rsquo;s cloudy. 
      
      - **Stay safe**: Stick to pavement that&rsquo;s been cleared of mud or snow. In fickle weather, walk a route that is lined with duck-out spots &mdash; like libraries or coffee shops &mdash; so you can seek shelter if gusts or precipitation pick up. 
      
      - **Easy alternatives:** Avoid the elements altogether by trekking indoors &mdash; the mall, a treadmill, or the stairs in your office building are great locations to get in your 30 minutes, five days a week. 
      
      With a little planning and preparation, you can keep up your walking routine in any weather.

      No matter where you live, weather swings can dampen your inspiration to get outdoors for a walk. Remain faithful to walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week with these hints:
      
      - **Clothing:** Layering is the key, especially in colder climates. Wear a hooded windproof, water-resistant outer layer, a micro-fleece pullover for a middle layer, and moisture-wicking leggings, tanks, or shirts next to your skin. Add a hat and gloves, if necessary. Light waterproof hiking shoes or boots will protect from the elements and provide traction. And don't forget sunglasses -- even when it's cloudy. 
      
      - **Stay safe:** Stick to pavement that's been cleared of mud or snow. In fickle weather, walk a route that is lined with duck-out spots -- like libraries or coffee shops -- so you can seek shelter if gusts or precipitation pick up. 
      
      - **Easy alternatives:** Avoid the elements altogether by trekking indoors -- the mall, a treadmill, or the stairs in your office building are great locations to get in your 30 minutes, five days a week. 
      
      With a little planning and preparation, you can keep up your walking routine in any weather.

      On Valentine&rsquo;s Day, you may share sweets with family, friends, or co-workers. Chocolate treats are typically high in fat, sugar, and calories, but certain types of chocolate also offer powerful disease-fighting components. Here are some healthy ways to satisfy your chocolate craving:
      
      - **Choose dark.** Due to a higher cocoa content than milk chocolate, dark chocolate contains more flavonoids, which are naturally occurring compounds with antioxidant properties that can improve blood pressure and reduce cholesterol. Dark chocolate also tends to be lower in sugar. Look for varieties that specify 70 percent cacao content or higher.
      
      - **Opt for cocoa powder.** Cocoa powder consists of the fine particles that form when cocoa beans are ground and stripped of cocoa butter &mdash; i.e., their fat content. So if you bake with cocoa powder and other low-fat ingredients, you can create chocolaty treats that are lighter and lower in calories. In fact, a quarter cup of dark cocoa powder has only 50 calories.
      
      - **Keep it measured.** Be aware of how much chocolate you&rsquo;re eating. Consuming any food in excess will cause weight gain. Think twice before overindulging, and incorporate chocolate into a healthy diet.
      
      Here are some ideas to help you enjoy chocolate in moderation:
      
      - Dip strawberries or orange sections into a dark chocolate fondue.
      
      - Make your own trail mix with dark chocolate chips, nuts, and dried blueberries or cranberries.
      
      - Keep a dark chocolate bar in the freezer, and break off a small section to have after dinner. Or keep individually wrapped pieces instead of a large bar.

      &ldquo;Time to have some fun while staying healthy &mdash; gym, walking, dancing &mdash; anything that will get your heart rate up and keep you moving. Life is great when we enjoy staying healthy,&rdquo; Jacqueline Diaz, Receptionist, Northern California. 
      
      Draw in a breath of fresh perspective with these simple tips for applauding each day:
      
      - **Drink water.** 12 ounces help rehydrate your cells, jumpstart your metabolism, promote digestion/elimination, and enhance circulation. Get in the habit of drinking water throughout the day and keep a bottle by your nightstand to have when you wake. 
      
      - **Breathe deeply.** Summon energy for all you&rsquo;ll accomplish with 10 or so deep breaths: in to the count of six, then slowly exhale.
      
      - **Eat breakfast.** A healthy breakfast fuels your body and mind. For lasting energy, load up on protein and complex carbs like an egg and a fruit smoothie, or a bowl of oatmeal topped by berries with peanut butter toast on the side. 
      
      - **Get moving.** Moving for 10 minutes to music, a few jumping jacks, push-ups, jogging in place, or stretches can alert your body and mind to kick into gear while signaling hormone releases to crank up your mood.
      
      Your alarm is a summons to start anew, so get your day started with a healthy outlook and a spring in your step.

      &ldquo;My grandmother walked every day. She lived to be 105 and was able to live on her own until she was 103,&rdquo; Sharon Peters, Chief Administrative Officer, Northern California. 
      
      Walking is one of the simplest things you can do for your overall health &mdash; it is also fun and easy. All you need is a few minutes of spare time, and comfortable walking shoes. But we all have days when our motivation to walk may wane. On those days, try these techniques for pushing past mental barriers: 
      
      - **Break up your walk.** Mentally divide your workout into pieces. Fix your eyes on objects ahead, like a sign or a tree, and set incentives for arriving at each target &mdash; a drink of water or the chance to slow down for a beat. Resetting the mileage counter in your head when you finish a segment can renew resolve for the next leg. 
      
      - **Pump those arms.** Whether you want to bump up intensity or increase your pace, concentrate on pumping your arms while maintaining proper upper-body position &mdash; your lower body will follow, with less risk of sacrificing form. 
      
      - **Go the distance.** If those last steps are challenging, think positively. Synchronize the cadence of your stride by repeating an upbeat phrase &mdash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost there&rdquo; or &ldquo;I know I can!&rdquo; The internal message can add physical momentum.    
      
      A mental nudge may be all you need to summon the drive to walk 30 minutes a day, five days a week. Keep up the great work! 
      
      In addition to staying active, knowing your health status is one of the most important steps you can take to understanding your health. You can take the [Total Health Assessment](http://my.kp.org/healthworks/hwf/healthyworkforce/rewards.html) (THA) online questionnaire to see how you&rsquo;re doing overall. The Total Health Assessment is a quick and easy online tool that in just 20-30 minutes creates a health action plan just for you.

      For decades, heart disease was perceived as a man&rsquo;s illness. In reality, it&rsquo;s the leading cause of death in both men and women. And it can be tougher for women to [recognize the symptoms](http://www.goredforwomen.org). Rather than experiencing gripping chest pain, women often report tightness, aching, or pressure in the chest or other symptoms like nausea, and back and jaw pain.
      
      The good news is that heart disease is largely preventable. During National Heart Month (February), we encourage all women to renew their commitment to these keys ways to preserve your heart health. 
      
      - **Eat heart-healthfully.** Choose a diet high in produce and whole grains, which are naturally high in fiber and low in salt, cholesterol, and saturated fat. Avoid the trans-fats in packaged and fast foods, and aim to eat fish (like salmon and trout) two or more times a week. 
      
      - **Stop smoking.** Lighting up takes its toll &mdash; including the [risk of having a heart attack 19 years earlier than non-smokers](http://www.womensheart.org/content/HeartDisease/heart_disease_facts.asp).
      
      - **Exercise regularly.** Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderately intense exercise a week. Brisk walking is a great way to fit in exercise &mdash; anytime, anyplace. 
      
      - **Know your numbers.** Being aware of key data regarding your heart health is the first step. Get blood tests and other screenings regularly, and discuss your results with your doctor. Women should aim for the following numbers:
      
           - Blood pressure of 120/80 or lower
           - Total cholesterol less than 200 mg/dL 
           - LDL or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; cholesterol less than 100 mg/dL
           - HDL or &ldquo;good&rdquo; cholesterol greater than 50 mg/dL 
           - Triglycerides less than 150 mg/dL 
           - Blood glucose (HbA1c) less than 7 percent 
           - Body mass index (BMI) less than 25 
           - Waist circumference less than 35 inches.

      While [most experts recommend](http://www.apma.org/heel-pain-guide) new walking shoes every three to six months or 350 to 500 miles, other factors can affect their lifespan &mdash; from your weight and gait, to quality and wear, to how often they take a spin in the wash. These tips will help you know when to spring for a new pair of shoes:  
      
      - **Know the age.** Discontinued or clearance items may cost less, but they&rsquo;ve probably been sitting on a shelf for some time, which means the glue and insoles have aged. Purchase current models if possible.
      
      - **Extend the life.** Slow degeneration of your shoes by washing them on the cold, delicate setting and letting your shoes air dry. Reserve your walking shoes for their intended purpose &mdash; walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week. If possible, alternate between two pairs, and stow them in open air rather than a gym bag to prevent moisture buildup.  
      
      - **Note changes.** Pay attention to flattening in pads and contour as well as worn tread patterns. Look for any wrinkling or cracking on the sides and bottom. If your feet hurt, the insoles seem thinner, or you feel less spring action in your steps, buy a new pair when you can. 
      
      Keep the pep in your step. Wearing the right footwear is an important part of your walking routine.

      When your sweet tooth beckons, respond with a sumptuous, healthy treat. Your favorite dessert recipes can be made healthy by favoring fruit and substituting a few key ingredients:  
      
      - **Crumbs for crust.** Instead of a two-crust pie, make a fruit crisp with an oatmeal crumb topping. You&rsquo;ll take in fewer calories and gain more soluble fiber.
      
      - **Light cake for heavy biscuits.** Skip the shortcake and pour strawberries over angel food cake. You&rsquo;ll enjoy far less fat and fewer calories.
      
      - **Applesauce for oil.** Replace a portion of the oil in cake batter with pur&eacute;ed apples. Cutting one-third of a cup of oil can save over 50 calories and 6 grams of fat per serving.
      
      - **Homemade frozen yogurt for ice cream.** Indulge your ice cream craving with a cold treat you can make yourself in 10 minutes. Combine frozen fruit, equal parts low-fat plain yogurt and sugar, and a few drops of lemon juice in a food processor. Process until creamy and serve.
      
      - **More flavor for less sugar.** Reduce the sugar in any fruit recipe by 25 to 50 percent. You&rsquo;ll taste more fruit and save 45 calories for every tablespoon of sugar omitted.

      - **Alternate daily activities.** If you want to focus on a particular activity, are recovering from an injury, or you&rsquo;re just starting out, try doing a different type of exercise each day. Perhaps you walk 30 minutes Monday, swim the next day, and jump on a stationary bike mid-week. Whatever you do, try to switch between emphasis on your upper and lower body.
      
      - **Dedicate a single workout to several different exercises.** Consider a cardio combo that includes 10 minutes on an elliptical machine, 10 minutes jogging on the treadmill, and another 10 minutes on the bike.

      &ldquo;After a stressful day, the best remedy for me is to get out and walk, walk, and walk some more! Walking relieves the stress, relaxes me, and refreshes me to think clearer, then I eat more sensibly,&rdquo; Terry Hart, Revenue Cycle Operations Cashier, Southern California. 
      
      A daily walk feels great and bestows a wealth of body benefits &mdash; but what it does for your brain is nothing short of astonishing.
      
      Regular walking triggers positive changes in your brain&rsquo;s function and structure. Even a single walk results in chemical changes within the brain that encourage cell growth and optimize your ability to concentrate, solve problems, and learn. It improves motivation, alertness, and helps your brain cells fend off the natural effects of aging. 
      
      No matter how old or young you are, walking trains your brain. Our memories, jobs, and day-to-day lives depend on keeping our brains in good working order. A daily walk sets the stage for your brain to stay sharp &mdash; something you&rsquo;ll treasure more with each passing year. 
      
      - Regular walking balances chemicals &mdash; neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine that regulate brain activity while influencing mood, aggression, impulsiveness, attention, perception, motivation, and learning.
      
      - A brisk walk floods the brain with BDNF &mdash; a brain protein that promotes growth of neurons (brain cells), strengthens, and protects against negative changes associated with the aging process.
      
      - Walking may help preserve brain volume and protect memory in older adults.
      
      - [One study](http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/february2011/02282011exercise.htm) showed that older adults who exercised at least twice a week were 50 percent less likely to experience dementia. Check out the study from the University of Pittsburgh, showing exercise resulted in brain growth.

      "After a stressful day, the best remedy for me is to get out and walk, walk, and walk some more! Walking relieves the stress, relaxes me, and refreshes me to think clearer, then I eat more sensibly," Terry Hart, Revenue Cycle Operations Cashier, Southern California. 
      
      A daily walk feels great and bestows a wealth of body benefits -- but what it does for your brain is nothing short of astonishing.
      
      Regular walking triggers positive changes in your brain's function and structure. Even a single walk results in chemical changes within the brain that encourage cell growth and optimize your ability to concentrate, solve problems, and learn. It improves motivation, alertness, and helps your brain cells fend off the natural effects of aging.

      Here&rsquo;s some good news: One of our favorite snack foods is extremely nutritious. Nuts can help strengthen bones, lower cholesterol, regulate blood pressure, and prevent cancer. Which nuts are the healthiest and what can they do for you?
      
      - **Almonds** have more vitamin E and calcium than most nuts. Just one ounce provides about 35 percent of your daily requirement for vitamin E and 8 percent of your daily calcium. Their high fiber content helps to keep your gastrointestinal tract balanced for a healthy colon. Because over 60 percent of their fat is monounsaturated, almonds can help lower cholesterol and reduce your risk of heart disease.
      
      - **Hazelnuts** are loaded with iron and flavonoids that can help strengthen blood vessels and may prevent urinary tract infections. The vitamin E and sterols in hazelnuts help lower cholesterol to keep your heart healthy.
      
      - **Pistachios** have more potassium than most nuts and are high in protein, making them a great postworkout recovery snack. They contain significant amounts of lutein and zeaxanthin &mdash; carotenes that help maintain your vision. A serving of pistachios is also lower in calories than any other tree nut.
      
      - **Walnuts** contain omega-3 fatty acids, which help prevent inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Their powerful antioxidants support your immune system and fight cancer.
      
      Enjoy nuts on their own or include them in healthy [recipes](http://recipe.kaiser-permanente.org/?s=nuts). Keep in mind, however, that nuts are dense in calories, so keep your portion size to a handful a day.

      Pedestrian-friendly communities are desirable places to live, work, and play. Walkable towns enjoy lower transportation costs, cleaner air, and better overall health. Want to help your community become more walkable?  Here are some ideas to get you started:
      
      - **Renew your community center.** Main Street is a community&rsquo;s heart. Healthy ones provide essential goods and services within easy walking distance while drawing people in with distinct local character. Encourage your town to revitalize with tips from the National Trust for Historic Preservation&rsquo;s [Main Street program](http://www.preservationnation.org/main-street/about-main-street/). 
      
      - **Advocate for walkers.** Let community leaders know you strongly support improvement strategies that make walking a practical, safe, and appealing choice. Lining streets with shade trees and illuminating them well at night, repairing sidewalks, and installing benches and medians signal to walkers that they&rsquo;re truly welcome. 
      
      - **Explore useful resources.** Find walker-friendly information, grant opportunities, and programs at [walkinginfo.org](http://www.walkinginfo.org/index.cfm). This comprehensive site offers a checklist you can use to assess your neighborhood&rsquo;s walkability. It also includes a directory of State Pedestrian/Bicyclist Coordinators, who connect communities with state and federal resources promoting carless travel, and help local lawmakers draft pedestrian-friendly legislation.

      Often we run out the door in the morning with no idea what we&rsquo;ll eat at noon. On those days, we&rsquo;re more likely to end up at the drive-through. Avoid the fast-food lure by packing nutritious fare that keeps you on course for a slimmer waistline &mdash; and a fatter wallet. Here are a few tips:
      
      
      
      - **Be all-inclusive.** For lunch, you can cover all the food groups with simple combinations. Put turkey on whole wheat with romaine lettuce. Add a yogurt cup and some nuts for crunch. Throw in an apple for a complete, tasty meal that&rsquo;s light and easy to tote.
      
      
      - **Twice as nice.** There&rsquo;s no reason to reinvent the wheel. Put last night&rsquo;s leftovers in a temperature-controlled sack for lunch. Hearty soups, veggie-rich casseroles, and whole-grain pasta dishes are just as nourishing the second time around. Leftover chicken breast served on a nine-grain roll, dressed up with honey mustard, tomato, and hummus, makes for a tasty low-calorie alternative to an ordinary sub. Or dice leftover chicken into a salad to give your greens protein power.
      
      
      - **Pack a thermos.** Pack low-sodium vegetable soup to go with a whole-grain grilled cheese sandwich on whole grain bread. Or freeze a fruit smoothie the night before and take it to work. By lunchtime, you&rsquo;ll have a cool, slushy beverage.

      Walking is one of the best things you can do for your overall health. You can feel confident that no matter what your pace or fitness level, you will receive significant health benefits with a consistent walking routine. You can also tone your arms while boosting aerobic benefits by integrating simple exercises into your walk:
      
      
      - **Work your biceps.** Do bicep curls as you walk or at each stoplight &mdash; 15 to 20 reps. Alternate arms or do both at the same time. Mix it up by changing the position of your wrists &mdash; pumping with your palms facing toward your body, then away.
      
      
      - **Trigger your triceps.** From a 90-degree angle with your palms facing inward, extend both arms behind you, bringing your shoulder blades together and isolating the triceps. Hold for three seconds before slowly releasing.
      
      
      - **Rotate your rotator cuff.** Hold your arms horizontally out to the side and move them in small, steady circles 20 times in both directions. 
      
      
      - **Focus on technique.** Keep your arms bent 90 degrees and swing them alongside your body up to your chest. Don&rsquo;t cross the center line or clench your fists. 
      
      With a few simple additions, walking can really tone up your arms.

      You probably know when your stomach&rsquo;s empty &mdash; the belly bellows are evidence enough. But how can you be sure when you&rsquo;ve had enough? Use these tips to gauge your fullness and know when it&rsquo;s time to quit.

      &ldquo;I have found packing my lunch not only saves me money, but I am eating healthier, less calories, carbs, and refined sugar; there is also no temptation for that cookie that you see or those chips you find at the cafe.&rdquo; Jamillah Garrison, Department Secretary, Northern California.
      
      For most families, groceries use up the biggest chunk of income after housing and transportation. When you&rsquo;re shopping with cost in mind, you may be tempted by inexpensive, prepackaged foods. Unfortunately, many of these foods carry a hefty price &mdash; in calories, fat, and sodium. You can eat healthfully on a budget if you follow these tips:
      
      
      - **Farm it out.** Visit a farmers market near home or work. When you support local farms, you&rsquo;re helping the community, the environment, your health, and your wallet.
      
      
      - **Grow your own.** The most economical choice of all is starting your own garden. You&rsquo;ll get some exercise and enjoy the literal fruits of your labor.
      
      
      - **Cut down on meat.** To save money, serve smaller portions of meat and fill your plate with produce and whole grains instead. Also, opt for a vegetarian meal a few times a week. It can be as easy and tasty as adding zucchini instead of beef to your marinara sauce.
      
      
      - **Stock up.** Keep your eye out for sales or coupons on frozen fruits and veggies. It helps to keep canned goods on hand, but check the sodium content and the canning liquid (choose pears stored in natural juice instead of syrup, for example).
      
      
      - **Plan ahead.** Plan some meals for the coming week and shop from a list. The time and money you&rsquo;ll save at the grocery store will be well worth it.
      
      Shopping on a budget doesn&rsquo;t have to be hard or unhealthy. Choose wisely, with nutrition in mind, and remember you have options beyond your grocer&rsquo;s shelves.

      Healthy bones help maintain quality of life as we age. Take charge of your skeletal health today &mdash; prevent needless back pain and injuries by walking daily and incorporating other bone-building habits into your routine.
      
      Bones reach peak level density around age 30 &mdash; after that, a small amount of bone mass is lost every year due to age-related changes. But regular weight-bearing exercise offsets bone loss associated with age. 
      
      Choose activities that place higher demands on your bones than normally encountered in daily living. Activities like walking, hiking, or group fitness classes place stress on the bones &mdash; which reduces bone loss. And the [best physical activity plan for bone health](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9927006) also includes strength training (resistance training) &mdash; lifting weights or using weight machines, exercising with elastic bands, doing push-ups or other body weight workouts, and jumping. 
      
      
      - Postmenopausal women who walk for at least four hours a week &mdash; but do no other exercise &mdash; have [41 percent less risk of hip fracture](http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/288/18/2300.abstract) compared with those who exercise less than one hour a week.
      
      
      - Start with weight-bearing activities &mdash; walking 30 minutes, five times a week &mdash; helps build muscular strength, balance, and coordination to reduce your risk of falls.
      
      
      - Load-bearing activities like jumping can benefit your bones in short chunks of time &mdash; even 5 or 10 minutes a day.

      It&rsquo;s been said that a journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step. Your morning meal is the most important nutrient boost of your day, and helps keep you energized and focused for all that follows. Breakfast devotees have even been found to maintain a healthier weight than people who skip breakfast. Follow these guidelines for a healthy start:
      
      
      - **Protein:** Even the healthiest carbs may digest too rapidly, leaving you hungry again by 10 a.m. Add protein to help moderate the energy surge so you feel fuller longer. Go with peanut butter instead of jam on your toast. Serve scrambled eggs with your fruit cup. Or create a parfait of low-fat yogurt, berries, whole-grain cereal, and almonds. Try Greek yogurt for extra protein and staying power.
      
      
      - **Preparation:** While skipping breakfast may help you get out the door on time, it will cost you productivity in the long run. Save yourself the slump and set your alarm a few minutes earlier. Or have ready-made snacks on standby for those rushed mornings: Hard-boil eggs the night before or cut up fruit ahead of time, then toss in your dry cereal or serve with yogurt.
      
      
      - **Pioneering:** Nobody said breakfast had to comprise breakfast foods. If you don&rsquo;t fancy the standards, think outside the cereal box. Enjoy last night&rsquo;s leftovers or a lunchtime dish &mdash; just keep the meal well-rounded.

      The simple act of walking may seem like second nature, and it is. Walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week can also improve overall balance and coordination. 
      
      
      - Walking strengthens bones so you&rsquo;re better apt to handle a misstep. [It even lowers hip fracture risk in women by 55 percent](http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/288/18/2300.abstract). 
      
      
      - Practicing can enhance walking ability in sufferers of brain impairment or injury. [Studies](http://news.ufl.edu/2011/05/26/stroke-rehab) find that stroke patients who walked on a treadmill improved overall stability and speed well into the first year of recovery. 
      
      
      - Walking not only engages the lower extremities, core, and back to improve physical control, it also strengthens nerve connections between body and mind that coordinate movement.
      
      Find time for your walk today. Not only will it help you enjoy overall good health, it will also improve your balance and coordination.

      Health headlines continue to promote the importance of eating whole grains. Found to lower the risk of cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, whole grains deserve a prominent place in your pantry. Consider these options for serving up whole grains to the whole gang:
      
      
      - Loaves of bread aren&rsquo;t the only item worthy of a grain swap. Try whole-wheat pita bread or tortillas, too. Cook up brown or wild rice instead of white, which has been stripped of its nutrients (the same holds true for whole-grain pasta versus standard spaghetti).
      
      
      - For gluten-free households, try quinoa, a complete protein that can replace rice, pasta, or couscous in recipes calling for starchy sides. Or sample buckwheat as a breakfast porridge or pancake flour.
      
      
      - Pay attention to ingredients. Just because a muffin is brown doesn&rsquo;t make it whole grain (bran doesn&rsquo;t qualify because it&rsquo;s a whole-grain byproduct). Look for &ldquo;100 percent whole grain&rdquo; on the label or the whole-grain stamp on the package. Avoid items with words like refined, white, or enriched, especially when coupled with flour, at the beginning of the ingredient list. When in doubt, make sure products that tout their whole-grain status back up that claim by mentioning whole grain in the first three ingredients.

      There&rsquo;s nothing like brown bananas or wilted celery to curb your appetite for fruits and veggies. By storing them properly, you&rsquo;ll avoid waste and enjoy produce with all its health benefits &mdash; and taste &mdash; intact. 
      
      
      - **First in, first out.** Follow the &ldquo;FIFO&rdquo; rule: Use oldest items first and rotate your supply to avoid spoilage. 
      
      
      - **Fresh.** Use fresh produce within a few days for the best flavor and texture. Some things, like tomatoes, bananas, and squash, stay fresh on the kitchen countertop. Others, such as celery and apples, keep better refrigerated in plastic bags. Visit the [Fruit & Veggie Nutrition Database](http://www.fruitsandveggiesmorematters.org/?page_id=164) for advice on specific items.
      
      
      - **Canned.** Stow cans at room temperature. Most canned goods have a two-year shelf life, but heed the &ldquo;use by&rdquo; date. 
      
      
      - **Frozen.** Keep frozen items in original packaging or airtight containers at 0 degrees or colder. Consume them within six months or by the designated &ldquo;use by&rdquo; date.
      
      
      - **Dried.** Store dried fruit in a cool, dark place in airtight containers. Some dried fruits may be refrigerated &mdash; check packages for storage instructions. Most keep their flavor and nutritional value for up to a year.

      Warming up before exercise doesn&rsquo;t just help protect you from injury &mdash; it can also enhance your performance. So get the most from walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week with a pre- and post-walk routine. Take a five-minute stroll that&rsquo;s purposefully slow to prepare your heart, legs, hips, and back for the more vigorous exercise ahead. Or, if you have extra time, try adding dynamic movements to your warm up: 
      
      
      - **Dynamic movements.** Especially in cold weather or if you&rsquo;re nursing a sore body part, range-of-motion exercises can help loosen stiff ligaments and muscles. Roll your ankles around in circles and do slow-motion high knee raises. After your warm-up, continue on with your walk &mdash; gradually picking up speed until you reach a pace you are comfortable with. And remember, the most important thing is to simply enjoy your walk. After a refreshing and rejuvenating 30-minute walk, remember to cool down for a few minutes by walking at a slower pace. Make sure to stretch after your walk as well when it&rsquo;s most effective.
      
      - **Stretch it out.** Target areas especially engaged during your walk. Stretch your [calves and Achilles](http://www.acefitness.org/exerciselibrary/152/standing-dorsi-flexion-calf-stretch), [hamstrings](http://www.acefitness.org/exerciselibrary/235/supine-hamstrings-stretch), and [quads](http://www.acefitness.org/exerciselibrary/149/side-lying-quadriceps-stretch).

      Cooking dry beans from scratch is worth the time and effort. Beans like black, lima, navy, and pinto are great sources of calcium, fiber, folate, iron, potassium, and protein. They&rsquo;re also associated with benefits like better weight control and reduced risk of heart disease and some cancers.
      
      Soaking is the first step for most beans, but no soaking is required for lentils, split peas, or black-eyed peas. [Recommended soaking techniques](http://food.unl.edu/web/fnh/dry-beans-from-scratch) include:
      
      
      - Cover a pound of dried beans with 10 cups of water in a stockpot.
      
      
      - Refrigerate for six to eight hours.
      
      
      - Drain and rinse. 
      
      
      Here are the basic cooking tips: 
      
      
      - Return soaked and rinsed beans to stockpot and cover them with triple their volume in water.
      
      
      - Add herbs or spices &mdash; not salt &mdash; as desired.  
      
      
      - Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, and gently simmer uncovered.
      
      
      - Check beans after 45 to 60 minutes; times vary, but most cook within 60 to 90 minutes.
      
      
      - Drain when tender. Beans are done when easily mashed with a fork. If saving them for later use, immerse them in cold water until cool, drain well, and then freeze.

      Here are the basic cooking tips: 
      
      
      - Return soaked and rinsed beans to stockpot and cover them with triple their volume in water.
      
      
      - Add herbs or spices -- not salt -- as desired.  
      
      
      - Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, and gently simmer uncovered.
      
      
      - Check beans after 45 to 60 minutes; times vary, but most cook within 60 to 90 minutes.
      
      
      - Drain when tender. Beans are done when easily mashed with a fork. If saving them for later use, immerse them in cold water until cool, drain well, and then freeze.

      Spring&rsquo;s  warmer temperatures and extended sunlight lure many walkers and runners from hibernation. While diverse sights and paths of the great outdoors inspire increased activity, [safeguards](http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00132) should be kept in mind.
      
      
      - **Be prepared.** Stick to familiar areas that are highly populated. Plan your route and tell someone where you&rsquo;re going and when you&rsquo;ll return. When running alone, carry identification, a cell phone, and a whistle or noisemaker for emergencies. Walk or run with a partner. Know the weather forecast and dress appropriately.
      
      
      - **Stay vigilant.** If you use headphones, be sure to keep the volume low so you can hear traffic and other people. Wear reflective clothing at dusk or dawn (avoid running in the dark). Be especially wary of vehicles &mdash; assume drivers aren&rsquo;t paying attention and don&rsquo;t see you. Always choose sidewalks and designated walking-running paths. 
      
      
      - **Protect your skin.** Apply a sunscreen of SPF 30 or stronger about 20 minutes before running, especially between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when ultraviolet rays are most dangerous. Also wear sunglasses and a visor.
      
      
      - **Keep hydrated.** Drink 10-15 ounces of fluid 10-15 minutes before running and every 20-30 minutes during your route.
      
      
      - **Minimize injury risk.** After 300-500 miles, shoes with receding tread absorb less shock and need replacing. Warm up for five minutes and then stretch before your jaunt. Stretch and cool down afterward. 
      
      Put safety first when heading out for 30 minutes a day, five days a week.

      Dark-green leafy vegetables provide nutrients like vitamins A and C, calcium, fiber, and folate. They&rsquo;re low in calories and sodium and high in phytonutrients, which are [associated](http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/foodnut/09373.html) with helping to prevent chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease. They also make a vibrant and delicious compliment to just about any meal. Here are good greens to grab:
      
      
      - **Kale.** Wash and dry this hardy, cruciferous vegetable and remove stems before finely chopping it. Then add to chili, soup, spaghetti sauce, or stir-fry. Be sure to only cook kale for a few minutes, or until bright green, to avoid any bitter taste.    
      
      
      - **[Collard greens.](http://recipe.kaiser-permanente.org/?s=collard+greens)** This versatile, smooth-leaved kale cousin can be cooked and incorporated in various soups, stews, and casseroles, such as vegetarian lasagna. Try dipping the large whole leaves in boiling water for a few seconds, then use them like a tortilla &mdash; filling them with your favorite burrito or wrap ingredients.  
      
      
      - **[Spinach.](http://recipe.kaiser-permanente.org/?s=spinach&x=0&y=0)** For a crunchy bite, pile these raw leaves on lean chicken or turkey sandwiches. Or combine them in salads with other leafy greens like arugula and romaine lettuce.
      
      
      - **[Watercress.](http://recipe.kaiser-permanente.org/?s=watercress)** The green leaves of watercress have a distinct peppery flavor that adds zip to sandwiches and salads.

      With quality sleep, you can arise energetic and alert. What&rsquo;s more, insomnia and long-term sleep deprivation can decrease your quality of life and increase your risk of high blood pressure, stroke, heart attack, and obesity. If you&rsquo;re having trouble getting seven to nine hours of sleep per night, consider these [suggestions](http://www.eatingwell.com/nutrition_health/mind_body_spirit/6_remedies_for_sleep_problems):
      
      
      - **Eat a later dinner.** If a rumbling belly keeps you tossing and turning, plan your last meal of the day a half-hour later and you&rsquo;ll be less likely to wake up hungry. Make sure it includes lean protein, whole grains, plenty of vegetables, and fruit for dessert.
      
      
      - **Mind your fluid intake.** Not drinking a few hours before bedtime can prevent sleep-interrupting bathroom breaks. And avoid alcohol four to six hours before your head hits the pillow; it can cause headaches, night sweats, and nightmares.
      
      
      - **Don&rsquo;t have caffeine four to six hours before sleeping.** Limit coffee, cola, tea, and chocolate to earlier in the day. Also check over-the-counter and prescription drug labels for caffeine content.

      &ldquo;I'm fortunate to have a walking partner and we encourage each other when either of us doesn&rsquo;t want to go. Once we're out there we're always glad we went.&rdquo; Nancy C. Turner, Distribution Supervisor Supply Chain Management Northern California.
      
      Raising your heart rate with regular cardio exercise gives your mood and energy level a boost and is linked with weight control, stronger bones and muscles, and lower risks of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. The [CDC recommends](http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/guidelines/adults.html) at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity a week.
      
      [Moderate-intensity exercise](http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/measuring/index.html) includes walking briskly (three miles an hour or faster &mdash; but not race-walking), water aerobics, bicycling slower than 10 miles an hour, and doubles tennis. 
      
      Vigorous-intensity exercise includes race-walking, jogging, running, bicycling 10 miles an hour or faster, singles tennis, aerobic dancing, jumping rope, and hiking uphill or with a heavy backpack. 
      
      To make sure your heart is working hard enough &mdash; but not too hard &mdash; use these tools: 
      
      
      - [Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) chart](http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/everyone/measuring/exertion.html). Use your overall feeling of effort &mdash; not just your breathing or how tired your muscles feel. An RPE of 11-14 is typical for moderate exercise; 15-17 is vigorous. 
      
      
      - Talk test &mdash; with moderate exercise, you breathe faster but can still carry on a conversation. If you can talk with some difficulty, your pace is vigorous; if you can&rsquo;t talk at all, you need to reduce intensity.
      
      Raise your activity level slowly, increasing total mileage or exercise minutes by no more than 10 percent a week.

      Studies suggest that cooking produce can reduce its nutritional integrity. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to go raw to get your vitamins and minerals. Certain techniques preserve nutritional quality better than others, and heat isn&rsquo;t always bad. Some foods, like corn and tomatoes, contain antioxidants that are actually unleashed when exposed to higher temperatures.
      
      
      - **Steam:** Boiling often leaches nutrients from foods. But steaming locks in more of the healthy components and flavor. For a taste boost, use a seasoned liquid like vegetable broth.
      
      
      - **Microwave:** One study found that cooking veggies in a [microwave retained 90 percent of their vitamin C](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2006.00258.x/abstract). But microwaving has its drawbacks, like hot spots and some controversy over radiation penetrating foods. If you&rsquo;re concerned, try a pressure cooker, which also preserves nutrients.
      
      
      - **Stir-fry:** Avoid slow-frying, which is a nutritional no-no due mostly to the large amounts of butter and oil. Instead, stir-fry or saut&#233; veggies for short spurts with nothing more than a tablespoon of water or broth. Or coat the pan with a little olive oil cooking spray to help avoid scorching.
      
      
      - **Reduce surface exposure:** Cook veggies whole or cut them into large chunks. The less exposure vegetables have to air or water, the more nutrients will stay intact.

      &ldquo;When the going gets tough, the tough better get walking. I always feel better after a walk. Gives one time to think through problems and even if solutions aren&rsquo;t forthcoming, the problems don&rsquo;t seem so heavy.&rdquo; Christine Williams, Case Manager, Northern California.
      
      Need to blow off a little steam and get some fresh air? A brisk walk every day is just the thing for reducing stress and giving you a needed burst of energy.
      
      Although some stress in our lives is inevitable, ongoing, high levels of stress is harmful to our physical and emotional well-being, and is associated with heart disease. The good news is that walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week, is one of the best ways to reduce stress levels:
      
      
      - Walking increases endorphin production and neuron development, helping to improve your mood.
      
      
      - Walking can decrease stress by expanding your social network. Neighborhood walking, for example, increases your chances of bumping into &mdash; and getting to know &mdash; your neighbors.
      
      
      - A study of premenopausal women found those who walked five days a week, reported significantly less stress, anxiety, and depression during and after menopause than those who were inactive or less active.
      
      Walk away from stress, and toward a more balanced outlook on life.

      As an athlete, making high-energy food choices at every meal is a vital part of your lifestyle &mdash; but that&rsquo;s not the only consideration. What you eat and drink just before, during, and after your workout matters, too. The right amount and types of foods and fluids at the right times will help you achieve your peak performance.
      
      Complex carbs &mdash; like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables &mdash; are the mainstay of sports nutrition. Just over half of your daily calories should come from carbs; they&rsquo;re stored as glycogen in the body, which is broken down into glucose to fuel your workout.
      
      
      - **Before exercise.** If your stomach is empty, your performance will suffer. If it&rsquo;s been three to four hours since your last meal, have a small snack &mdash; like trail mix, nuts or fruit, and water &mdash; an hour or so before your workout.
      
      
      - **During exercise.** Staying well hydrated prevents overheating and excess fatigue. During heavy exercise, drink about 6 to 12 ounces of water every 15 to 20 minutes. For workouts longer than 90 minutes, eat 15 to 30 grams of carbs every 30 minutes. 
      
      
      - **After exercise.** For optimum recovery, drink plenty of fluids with a meal that combines carbs and a lean protein within two hours of completing your workout.

      The next time you feel an afternoon slump coming on, perk up with a refreshing, caffeine-free, sugar-free drink: water. It supplies the fluid your body craves without ingredients that drag you down.
      
      Coffee and other caffeinated beverages temporarily boost alertness, but they take a toll on your body, stimulating a surge of stress hormones and acting as a diuretic (which speeds up the process of water loss through urine). Dehydration can lead to low blood pressure, which can make you feel weak, tired, and cranky. 
      
      Meanwhile, sugary drinks trigger a sharp rise in blood sugar, followed by a sharp decline. 
      
      So-called &ldquo;energy&rdquo; drinks are also a product to avoid &mdash; especially for children. While the Food and Drug Administration limits the amount of caffeine in products sold as food, energy drinks are sold as dietary supplements; many contain caffeine combined with herbs that can cause life-threatening symptoms if consumed in large amounts.
      
      If you&rsquo;re reluctant to drink water because you think it&rsquo;s bland or boring, get creative: 
      
      
      - Flavor your water with orange, cucumber, or lemon slices.
      
      
      - Freeze 100 percent fruit juice in ice cube trays and drop a cube or two into your water bottle.
      
      
      - Enjoy the carbonation of sparkling water or mineral water &mdash; available in many flavored variations as well.
      
      
      - Brew up a cup of caffeine-free herbal tea. There are dozens of flavors to choose from &mdash; like peppermint, cinnamon-apple, and honey-chamomile.

      - Enjoy the carbonation of sparkling water or mineral water -- available in many flavored variations as well.
      
      
      - Brew up a cup of caffeine-free herbal tea. There are dozens of flavors to choose from -- like peppermint, cinnamon-apple, and honey-chamomile.

      Spring presents an opportunity to renew your wellness commitment &mdash; and the American Heart Association&rsquo;s National Walking Day on April 2 can provide an extra incentive. Find out more information [here][1].
      
      &ldquo;Walking is the only time I have that&rsquo;s just for me &mdash; not work, not my daughter, not my husband, just me. And it makes me feel so much better, physically and mentally! I think I&rsquo;d be very grumpy if I didn&rsquo;t walk regularly.&rdquo; Sharon Hudson, Research Scientist, Southern California Region.  
      
      It feels great when we commit to a walking routine and stick to it. We can take pride in accomplishing something we set out to do, and in knowing we are taking important steps for our health.  
      
      Walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week is not only a fun and easy thing to do, it can also enhance our mood and actually improving our physical health. Here&rsquo;s how: 
      
      - **One step at a time.** Walking increases natural feel-good hormones, which perk up our energy and improve our outlook. Saving time for a 30-minute walk before an important event can also be beneficial &mdash; for example, a walk can help boost focus and clear the mind before an important meeting.   
      
      - **Get friendly.** Social interaction can build confidence. Reap the benefits of this interaction by partnering with a friend or joining a walking group.  
      
      Getting out for a walk is a great way to feel good &mdash; both physically and mentally.

      You don&rsquo;t often think of hors d&rsquo;oeuvres as part of supper at home. But serving nutritious appetizers can help you feel great while you meet your produce requirements and actually promote portion control&hellip; if you do it right. Check out these tips for getting the most from starters.
      
      - **Nibble on raw veggies with healthy dips.** Appease hunger while the main dish cooks with quick wash-and-ready options like carrots, celery, and broccoli with low-fat ranch or hummus. The protein-rich dips help ease tummy grumbles so you&rsquo;ll eat less at dinner, while getting a dose of vegetables upfront to load up on the most powerful nutrients. 
      
      - **Serve traditional sides as pre-meal finger foods.** The U.S.D.A. recommends covering half your plate in fruits and veggies. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean you have to eat it all at once. Dish up simple sides like roasted artichokes, grilled asparagus, or stuffed mushrooms ahead of time and enjoy them without guilt. 
      
      - **Stick to salad.** [Leafy greens][1] boast many micro-nutrients that promote general health and may even defend against cancer and heart attack.

      You build a delicious salad loaded with crunchy greens, raw veggies, plus a handful of nuts and seeds. But if you saturate it with a high-calorie, sugar-infused dressing packed with artificial ingredients and trans-fats, the drawbacks begin to outweigh the benefits. Support your healthy salad by complementing, not sabotaging, nutritional synergy.
      
      - **Choose healthy oils.** Vinaigrettes are good choices, and you can easily make your own. Combine Balsamic vinegar with olive oil, a touch of honey, and mustard to add tang. Or mix Italian seasonings, garlic, salt, pepper, and onion powder with white vinegar and canola oil.
      
      - **Stick to homemade.** Even if you indulge in the occasional creamy topping, making it from scratch is often healthier than buying from the store. Not only can you control the kinds of ingredients, you can control the amounts. Don&rsquo;t assume the powdered packets are better than a bottle &mdash; they tend to be high in salt and other sodium derivatives like MSG.  
      
      - **Keep it simple.** Fewer ingredients usually equal healthier. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean sacrificing flavor. You can whip up a honey-mustard dressing using only those two ingredients and enjoy zest in every bite. Watered-down hummus and fresh salsa can even add an ethnic flair without kicking up the calorie count too much.

      A daily dose of walking is just the prescription you need to stay your healthy best. A common cold or virus can slow you down and be a real nuisance. Many theories, even old wives tales, abound on the best way to treat cold and flu conditions. It turns out walking can help you fight off illness, as well as help in the recovery process. [Recent research][1] points to moderately-paced walking for 30 minutes each day as a good way to fight viral infections and lessen severity of cold symptoms by: 
      
      - **Boosting immunity.** Each time you walk, your body releases antibodies and &ldquo;natural killer&rdquo; cells that get rid of other cells infected with viruses. These cells remain elevated for several hours after walking; their effect adds up to protect you over time. 
      
      - **Lowering harmful hormones.** Moderate walking decreases stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, which repress the immune system and reduce the body&rsquo;s ability to combat illnesses. 
      
      - **Enhancing recovery.** Maintaining strong muscles improves your overall health and makes it easier for your body to rest and recover quickly if you do become ill.

      Packing your lunch and making meals from scratch usually are healthier than dining out. But sometimes circumstances force you to feed on the go. Fortunately, if you&rsquo;re stuck between a rock and a fast-food place, all hope&rsquo;s not lost. Give yourself a fighting chance if you must swing through the drive-thru:
      
      - **Look for light options.** Find low-fat and low-sodium labels or make an educated guess based on the ingredients. Salads and veggie wraps are good bets, but order oil-based dressings on the side and avoid extras like bacon bits or croutons.
      
      - **Substitute sides.** For meal combos, choose fruit or veggies over fries, bread, or chips. If produce isn&rsquo;t on the menu, ask about yogurt. Go with black beans over refried beans. Or just order a la carte and avoid the calorie consideration altogether. Whatever you do, steer clear of the soda fountain. Go with unsweetened iced tea or water as your drink option. 
      
      - **Bear in mind the cooking method.** Grilled or broiled is always better than fried. Avoid fare that&rsquo;s battered or cooked in fat.
      
      - **Strip down your order.** Creamy sauces often give decent food a bad reputation. Ask to hold common condiments like mayonnaise or Thousand Island dressing. Try mustard, salsa, or vinegar/oil instead. 
      
      For some menu-specific guidance, go to [Consumer Reports fast food buying guide][1].

      - **Look for light options.** Find low-fat and low-sodium labels or make an educated guess based on the ingredients. Salads and veggie wraps are good bets, but order oil-based dressings on the side and avoid extras like bacon bits or croutons.
      
      - **Substitute sides.** For meal combos, choose fruit or veggies over fries, bread, or chips. If produce isn't on the menu, ask about yogurt. Go with black beans over refried beans. Or just order a la carte and avoid the calorie consideration altogether. Whatever you do, steer clear of the soda fountain. Go with unsweetened iced tea or water as your drink option. 
      
      - **Bear in mind the cooking method.** Grilled or broiled is always better than fried. Avoid fare that's battered or cooked in fat.
      
      - **Strip down your order.** Creamy sauces often give decent food a bad reputation. Ask to hold common condiments like mayonnaise or Thousand Island dressing. Try mustard, salsa, or vinegar/oil instead. 
      
      For some menu-specific guidance, go to Consumer Reports fast food buying guide.

      The kitchen is a hot spot for microbes. From raw meat juices that can spill across the countertop to germs retained on the surface of fruits and vegetables, it&rsquo;s no wonder the culinary corner is considered less sanitary than most bathrooms. Brush up on these [tips][1] to avoid foodborne illness as the result of an untidy kitchen:
      
      - Avoid using counter tops to slice and dice. Use cutting boards instead: one designated for raw meat and another for produce and ready-to-eat fare. When through using them, always wash boards by hand in hot, soapy water. Then spray them with a little vinegar or rub them with fresh lemon for extra disinfection. Get rid of old boards that develop knicks, scratches, or knife scars &mdash; they&rsquo;re bacterial breeding grounds.
      
      - Spray down the kitchen sink nightly with a bleach solution. And replace your dishtowels and rags daily. Toss sponges after a few uses or disinfect them by drenching them in water and then putting them in the [microwave][2] on high for at least two minutes. 
      
      - Don&rsquo;t forget to rinse the tops of canned food and bottles before opening them to remove factory or transportation residues and other germs that could contaminate the contents.
      
      Always wash your hands before and after handling food.

      &ldquo;Walking makes me feel good, doesn&rsquo;t take much preparation, and is easy to do anytime. It&rsquo;s great to walk with good friends, to chat, and catch up. I also enjoy walking by myself while listening to great music or a podcast. I always walk in nature; the fresh air and scenery feels rejuvenating.&rdquo; Sandy Jenter, junior web developer, Health Plan Institute. 
      
      There&rsquo;s more than safety in numbers &mdash; there&rsquo;s also accountability and friendship. While walking solo can be enjoyable and provide time for reflection, walking together with friends, family, or colleagues is fun and creates a synergy that can motivate and support you better than walking alone.
      
      There are many ways to partner up while walking:
      
      - Network with your colleagues via the Walking Wall or Sole Mates. Recruit your Sole Mates to go for regular lunchtime walks &mdash; start small with themes like &ldquo;Fridays on Foot.&rdquo; Use the Walking Wall to post information about a meeting time and place or simply send an email.
      
      - Take advantage of social networking sites to post your intentions. Ask your friends and family to join you for a weekend walk.
      
      - Check out local [walking clubs][1]. Or sign up for a charity walk or race with individuals who share your cause.
      
      Walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week, is more engaging when you invite others to take part. Start rallying your Sole Mates today!

      - **Build your own salad bar.** [Plan a day][1] where everyone brings in a healthy salad ingredient and low-fat dressing, and then arrange an attractive salad bar for all to share. Make sure someone brings a lean protein such as salmon, tofu, hard-boiled eggs, lentils or chickpeas to round out the meal. It&rsquo;s a great way to add produce &mdash; and variety &mdash; to your weekly fare. 
      
      - **Low-cal favorites day.** Have everyone bring in their favorite low-calorie dish and accompanying recipe for a no-guilt potluck and recipe swap.

      Experts recommend eating more produce than any other food group &mdash; filling at least half your plate with them at each meal. Here&rsquo;s why colorful fruit and vegetables are nutritional royalty.
      
      - Heart disease is the nation&rsquo;s number one killer. But studies conclude that a diet rich in produce can help keep cholesterol and blood pressure at healthy levels, while also reducing inflammation and improving arterial function. The antioxidant power of fruits and vegetables also can reduce risk of coronary events like stroke and deep vein thrombosis (which are blood clots that can be fatal). In fact, you&rsquo;re about 17 percent less likely to suffer a [heart attack][1] or [stroke][2] if you have five or more servings a day. What to buy? Leafy greens, cruciferous veggies, and citrus fruits are the top choices for your heart. 
      
      - Produce is also unrivaled in cancer prevention &mdash; from lycopene-rich tomatoes that lower prostate cancer risk, to greens like broccoli that can keep colon tumors at bay, to vitamin C-packed citrus fruits that may guard against stomach, esophagus, and mouth cancers. Plus the antioxidants may help slow the damage from free radicals that cause macular degeneration and cognitive decline.
      
      Plan now to insert at least one extra veggie into each of tomorrow&rsquo;s meals.

      Your daily walk can mean restful sleep. A [Stanford University Medical School study][1] showed that daily walking helps people fall asleep faster and sleep deeper, so they feel more rested during the day. The benefits are many:
      
      - Walking outside in the morning exposes you to natural light, reinforcing your sleep-wake cycle. The sunlight tells your brain it&rsquo;s time to wake up, keeping your biological clock on track.  
      
      - Walking in the early evening raises your body temperature above normal a few hours before bedtime, allowing it to start falling as you&rsquo;re preparing for bed. This decrease in body temperature eases you into sleep. 
      
      - Walking eases mental anxiety and muscular tension, for more peaceful sleep. 
      
      - Walking helps shed pounds, reducing the likelihood of sleep apnea and insomnia.  
      
      All of us welcome a peaceful night&rsquo;s sleep. It&rsquo;s good for our health and it&rsquo;s good for our overall sense of well-being. Feeling well-rested is yet another advantage of walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week.

In fact, according to the [Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine][1], most school meals are too high in saturated fat and too low in fiber, fruits, and veggies. Fortunately, you can pack healthy lunches for the entire family to meet higher standards. 
      
      - **Pre-prepare salads.** Give any combination of leafy greens a protein makeover by adding tuna, beans, hard-boiled eggs, or last night&rsquo;s grilled chicken. Fruit salads topped with nuts, or homemade sweet potato salad, are wholesome sides that both satisfy and fortify. Make healthy dishes for dinner and plan to save leftovers for the next day&rsquo;s lunches. 
      
      - **Offer options.** Most children eat small mini-meals throughout the day. Keep a variety of healthy snackables on hand, such as celery with all-natural peanut butter; grape tomatoes and part-skim string cheese; whole-grain crackers with slices of turkey; or carrot sticks with hummus or low-fat dressing. 
      
      - **Mimic menus.** Look what&rsquo;s on the school cafeteria menu or think about your favorite drive-thru go-to. With a little planning, you can put a healthy spin on these preferred standbys. Try whole-wheat English muffins topped with tomato sauce, low-fat mozzarella, and basil to satisfy that pizza craving, or stuff whole-grain tortillas with turkey slices, low-fat shredded cheese, lettuce, and avocado in place of greasy burgers. 
      Take 10 minutes each week to write out a meal plan for the next week&rsquo;s lunches.

      Involving your family in meal planning is a great way to encourage healthy eating habits, develop basic skills, and have fun at the same time. Kids love feeling like they&rsquo;re contributing, and they&rsquo;re much more likely to eat healthy foods when they&rsquo;ve played a part in decision-making and preparation. Here are a few ways to [help your kids help out in the kitchen][1]: 
      
      - **Preschool-age children.** Young kids can help add and mix ingredients, and decorate the final products. These activities develop coordination, teach new words, and build confidence.
      
      - **School-age children.** Grocery shopping is the ideal time to have conversations about making healthy food choices with your young kids. School-aged children can also help knead, stir, measure, and read a recipe, which are great ways to improve reading and math skills.
      
      - **Older children.** Engage older children in menu planning. Talk about nutrients and what makes up a well-balanced meal. At the grocery store, look at labels together &mdash; discuss calories, fat, and recommended daily values.
      
      Above all, make mealtime fun for the family. When you&rsquo;re done preparing, be sure to take your time eating and truly enjoy your meals together. It&rsquo;s no surprise: [Research][2] shows that kids who dine with their families have better communication and healthier eating habits.

      No matter what your fitness background, past or present, everyone can benefit from walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week. You may be an avid hiker, a long-distance walker, or you may simply walk your kids to school or around the neighborhood. Here&rsquo;s how you can benefit from consistent walking:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Increase strength.** Your muscles and bones become tougher with consistent walking, building power in your legs, hips, and back. Your heart, which is a muscle, is able to pump blood more effectively.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Boost vitality.** With stronger muscles and improved heart health, you&rsquo;ll feel more energetic and alert. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Age well.** By maintaining physical endurance and strength, you&rsquo;ll be better able to function physically as you age. It also improves brain function and lowers your risk for Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Brighten your day and future.** Walking helps control depression, enhances self-esteem, and improves your mental outlook. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      Walking brings both short- and long-term benefits. So, there&rsquo;s no time like the present to start walking. "

      Lean meat is a great source of protein, but you can get all the protein your body needs without it. Here&rsquo;s a primer on vegetarian sources. 
      
      - **Legumes.** Beans, peanuts, and lentils &mdash; different types of legumes &mdash; are loaded with protein. In addition, they&rsquo;re cholesterol-free, low-fat, and high fiber. 
      
      - **Soy.** Tofu, soy milk, and tempeh &mdash; all made from soybeans &mdash; are excellent meat replacements. Soy is considered a complete protein, meaning it contains all the amino acids humans need to eat (because our bodies don&rsquo;t produce them).
      
      - **Nuts.** Pistachios, almonds, walnuts, and other nuts pack protein, nutrients, and essential fatty acids. While nuts are high in fat compared to other plant foods, it&rsquo;s the healthy unsaturated kind. Still, it&rsquo;s important to keep portions in check to avoid consuming too many calories. Aim for just a handful of nuts or a tablespoon of nut butter a day. 
      
      - **Seeds.** Also high in essential fatty acids, seeds are excellent protein sources. Pumpkin, sunflower, sesame, and flax seeds are rich in minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants. 
      
      - **Perfect pairings.** While whole grains and beans each contain some protein, neither is a complete protein on their own. However, when paired together, they have all of the essential amino acids that make up a complete protein. Try winning combinations like black beans with corn tortillas, lentils and rice, or garbanzo beans with whole-wheat couscous. 
      
      Replacing all or some of your protein from meats with plant proteins can be part of a healthy diet.

      Make exercise fun by altering your routine. For more satisfying sweats:
      
      - **Assess your fitness level.** Know your baseline before beginning a new program. Record your pulse rate before and after a mile walk, how long it takes you to walk one mile, how many push-ups you can do at once, waist circumference, and body mass index. Comparing your data before and after changing workouts will tell you if you&rsquo;re making progress.
      
      - **Determine your fitness goals.** Do you want to train for a 5K run? Walk 10,000 steps/day? First-timers and rusty exercisers should avoid overtraining &mdash; add no more than 10 percent to weekly aerobic distances or about 5 percent to strength training loads.
      
      - **Identify your likes and dislikes.** If you enjoy camaraderie while working out, join walking and running clubs, pickup basketball and volleyball, spin classes, yoga, and Pilates. If you&rsquo;d rather fly solo, try walking, running, cycling, swimming, and weight training.
      
      - **Add variety.** Repetitive exercise can stress joints and muscles and leave them injury prone. Make [cross-training][1] part of your routine for more well-rounded conditioning and less monotony.

      The [average American][1] consumes about 3,400 milligrams a day of sodium &mdash; about 1.5 times more than the Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s dietary guidelines recommend. Heavy salt intake is linked to high blood pressure &mdash; a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke, and kidney disease. Here are some tips to help you lower your intake:
      
      - Flavor vegetables, grains, and meats with herbs and spices instead of salt. Try sodium-free garnishes like cumin, curry, garlic, nutmeg, oregano, paprika, pepper, rosemary, sage, tarragon, and turmeric. Also experiment with fresh citrus juice, flavored vinegars, and interesting oils such as pumpkin seed, toasted sesame, or walnut oil.
      
      - Avoid smoked and processed meats such as sausage, hot dogs, or deli meats.
      
      - Look for salt-free or low-sodium packaged foods. Items labeled &ldquo;sodium-free&rdquo; or &ldquo;salt-free&rdquo; contain 5 milligrams or less per serving. &ldquo;Very low sodium&rdquo; means 35 milligrams or less, and &ldquo;low sodium&rdquo; equals 140 milligrams or less.
      
      - When eating out, ask for nutritional information on menu items. Choose dressings and sauces on the side, if at all, or ask for low-sodium options. Also, eat more fruits and vegetables &mdash; most are naturally low in sodium.

      After a busy day, it&rsquo;s tempting to sit on the couch and tune out the world with screen time. But a walk will do much more to help you relax than the television or computer ever could. [Behavioral scientists][1] found that people who walk regularly recovered from stress better than couch potatoes. 
      
      Walking buffers stress by:
      
      - **Providing an opportunity to de-stress and connect with a friend.** Walking with a partner is an opportunity to share problems/solutions, find humor, and benefit from each other&rsquo;s insights. 
      
      - **Reducing muscle tension.** Walking with good form strengthens muscles, improves posture, and relieves stiffness. Under stress, many people tense their muscles and feel pain in their shoulders, neck, and back. 
      
      - **Distracting your mind.** Walking in fresh air diverts your attention and puts you in a new frame of mind. You observe the world around you, let your mind wander, and feel refreshed.
      
      If the couch is calling to you, think twice before taking a seat. It&rsquo;s simple to squeeze in time a walk. A walk is a more effective, more pleasurable way to unwind &mdash; and it&rsquo;s easy to fit in 30 minutes a day, five days a week.

      Vegetables often decorate the dinner plate, supporting the entr&eacute;e as sidekicks rather than principal players. But nutritional wisdom now suggests that dedicating your main dish to crops is a better choice. Plus, with more people becoming vegetarians, there&rsquo;s a growing demand for veggie-centered courses. Fortunately, the options are limitless.
      
      - Forget chicken. Eggplant parmesan qualifies as a main dish any day. And by sprucing up the sauce with mushrooms, spinach, and artichokes, you can increase nutritional quality while enhancing flavor. Try coating the eggplant in flaxseed and oats instead of processed bread crumbs. This boosts fiber while reducing sugar and fat.
      
      - Lasagna may be a household favorite, but meats used in the layers may not be kind to your heart. Put a spin on this popular casserole by swapping the meat with portobello mushrooms, chopped spinach, and mixed veggies (try broccoli, carrots, and squash). Use whole-grain noodles and lower-fat cheeses like part-skim mozzarella and ricotta, which contain less fat than their traditional whole-milk counterparts.
      
      - Enjoy the spicy flair of Mexican fare by building vegetable-heavy burritos or enchiladas. Stuff whole-grain tortillas with a variety of beans, corn, tomatoes, spinach, and mushrooms, then top with salsa and avocado instead of sour cream to boost antioxidants while reducing fat.

      Vegetables often decorate the dinner plate, supporting the entree as sidekicks rather than principal players. But nutritional wisdom now suggests that dedicating your main dish to crops is a better choice. Plus, with more people becoming vegetarians, there's a growing demand for veggie-centered courses. Fortunately, the options are limitless.
      
      - Forget chicken. Eggplant parmesan qualifies as a main dish any day. And by sprucing up the sauce with mushrooms, spinach, and artichokes, you can increase nutritional quality while enhancing flavor. Try coating the eggplant in flaxseed and oats instead of processed bread crumbs. This boosts fiber while reducing sugar and fat.

      Looking for inspiration to eat more vegetables? Grow them yourself. Chances are you&rsquo;ll eat more fresh produce if you cultivate your own. You don&rsquo;t even need a backyard &mdash; grow them on your windowsill or patio. Here&rsquo;s how:
      
      - **Take it easy.** Select crops that grow well with little care. Lettuce, tomatoes, and herbs ripen quickly and the plants continue growing after harvesting.
      
      - **Get creative.** Almost any vessel can hold crops. Chard looks great growing in a colander, and a laundry basket provides a perfect setting for basil. Try using coffee cans, canvas bags, or buckets. 
      
      - **Make holes.** Proper drainage keeps potted plants from drowning. Drill several holes in the container&rsquo;s bottom. Then line it with stones (not gravel), plastic packing peanuts, or burlap so that the soil remains intact while the water drains.
      
      - **Use quality soil.** Dirt collected from your backyard offers few nutrients, sprouts weeds, and compacts easily (which hinders growth). Potting soil has the right mix of perlite (expanded volcanic glass, which helps keep soil porous), nutrient-rich compost, and pure peat moss. 
      
      - **Feed and water.** Soil in pots dries faster than in the ground. Water your container plants daily and fertilize periodically as well. 
      
      - **Be patient.** Good things come to those who wait. If your plants don&rsquo;t produce, ask a [Master Gardener][1] for advice.

      Weekends are a great time to relax and unwind, and they also provide the opportunity to squeeze in extra time for a walk. You can easily incorporate your walk into everyday activities &mdash; such as walking around town or walking the dog. 
      
      You can also take more adventurous walks. Here are some ideas:
      
      - [**Go geocaching.**][1] A spin on classic scavenger hunting, geocaching gives you a chance to use your GPS (global positioning system) to search for &ldquo;treasures&rdquo; left by others. 
      
      - **Take a hike.** Setting out on rugged terrain is an invitation to get in touch with nature and a common cure for stress. Watch your footing on uneven ground, and bring a friend for companionship, as well as for safety. 
      
      - **Go on a sunset hike.** Starting off as sundown nears sets the stage for spectacular scenery and light. Wear light-colored clothing and bring a flashlight to ensure visibility as you head home after the sun sets. 
      
      Whether you&rsquo;re up for adventure or more comfortable with a traditional route, the most important thing is to walk.

      It&rsquo;s been said that the hardest working and most important muscle in our body is our heart. Not only does daily walking help make you feel good, it can also help protect your heart health in several ways.
      
      Every time you walk, your cardiovascular system becomes stronger and more efficient. A healthy heart can better handle the physical demands of life &mdash; running to catch a bus, chasing after young children, or doing yard work. The stamina gained with a fit heart enables you to enjoy life in ways that otherwise might not happen &mdash; hiking, dancing with a loved one, or exploring new places on foot, for example. 
      
      Regular walking can also improve your cardiovascular system in these ways:
      
      - Walking daily conditions your heart to perform better even when you are resting. 
      
      - Walking enhances the health of your blood vessels (arteries and veins). Even a single walk can decrease blood pressure for up to 24 hours.
      
      - Walking can raise HDLs (good cholesterol) and decrease blood fats called triglycerides. 
      
      Heart health directly affects quality of life &mdash; and you can improve both with a brisk walk every day.

      It may not seem like a high-maintenance appliance, but your refrigerator requires at least a little [TLC][1] to keep food fresh and stay energy efficient. So before you stuff it with another load of groceries, use these tips to care for your cooler:
      
      - Keep the condenser from collecting animal hair or dust by vacuuming the front grill regularly. Brush the coils twice a year at least (more often if you have pets that shed) or if you notice a warming trend inside the fridge. Just be sure to unplug the appliance first.
      
      - Remove leftovers and expired products weekly. Keep it simple &mdash; if you&rsquo;re unsure whether an item should be tossed, get rid of it.
      
      - Set the refrigerator temperature to under 40 degrees. Anything higher welcomes bacterial growth. 
      
      - Wipe up spills on the spot, especially raw juices. Store uncooked meats only on the bottom shelf to decrease risk of contamination. 
      
      - Deodorize the interior by placing a box of baking soda in the back &mdash; change it every three months.

      - **Lunch or dinner.** Make a grilled chicken salad with mixed greens and chopped apples, pears, or raisins. Throw cucumbers, spinach, or tomatoes on sandwiches. Make a simple side dish by heating up frozen vegetables. Add green peppers, apples, and celery to tuna salad made with low-fat mayo. And toss any kind of vegetable (fresh or frozen) into pasta sauces, soups, and stews.

      Many of us have activities planned from the moment we roll out of bed in the morning until we get back into bed at night. The good news is that there are lots of ways to fit walking into your day &mdash; and walking has great benefits even in increments of less than 30 minutes a day.
      
      [Studies suggest][1] that walking briskly 15 minutes twice a day &mdash; or 10 minutes three times a day &mdash; may be as good as a single 30-minute walk. There are some advantages to walking in longer segments, but if you&rsquo;re looking to feel good and benefit your health, smaller chunks of time work just as well.
      
      Here are some ideas for fitting in 10 minutes of walking several times a day. 
      
      - **Look for small pockets of time.** Got 10 minutes in between meetings? Stroll through the corridor or step outside for a brisk walk around your building &mdash; it counts! There is no amount of exercise that is insignificant.
      
      - **Energize your day.** Infuse part of your breaks at work with a short walk. Walk for 10 minutes during your morning break, 10 minutes at lunch time, and 10 minutes in the afternoon.
      
      - **Add walking to your daily routine.** Walk your kids to school or to the bus stop; walk after dinner; walk between stores instead of driving; complete all or part of your commute on foot.
      
      However you choose to fit it in, walking 30 minutes a day, five days a week is one of the best actions you can take to stay healthy.

      Most milk is fortified with [vitamin D][1], which helps boost immunity and strengthen bones &mdash; in fact, it&rsquo;s required for normal absorption of calcium and phosphorus. Otherwise, calorie, fat, and calcium content vary depending on the type of milk you buy. Check out the [nutritional details][2] below.

      - 2-percent (reduced-fat) milk: 121 calories, 4.7 grams of fat, and 297 milligrams of calcium
      - 1-percent (low-fat) milk: 102 calories, 2.6 grams fat, and 300 milligrams of calcium
      - Skim (fat-free) milk: 83 calories, zero fat, and 306 milligrams of calcium
      
      But you don&rsquo;t have to limit yourself to cow&rsquo;s milk. Nowadays, you have your choice of many delicious and nutritious alternatives: 
      
      - **Goat&rsquo;s milk.** Offering as much calcium as whole cow&rsquo;s milk, the protein in goat&rsquo;s milk may be easier to break down for many people. But it does contain lactose, which some people can&rsquo;t digest at all.
      
      - **Soy milk.** This lactose-free, soybean-based drink packs protein and calcium, and has no saturated fat. However, most brands have added sugars. Be sure to get the unsweetened variety.
      
      - **Almond milk.** This non-dairy mixture of soaked, ground almonds and water is a creamy alternative offering healthy doses of many vitamins and minerals. But it&rsquo;s low in protein compared to cow&rsquo;s milk. Like soy milk, it often contains sweeteners, so look for unsweetened versions.

      Walking is low impact and can be self-paced, which makes it doable by just about anyone. And it boosts mood, builds cardiovascular strength, and improves balance. Here are three more reasons to put one foot in front of the other: 
      
      - Hitting the pavement helps [relieve chronic and acute stress][1]. Whether you&rsquo;re feeling pressure on the job or at home, it kicks up endorphins to calm your nerves and burns toxic energy. Take 10 minutes to physically walk off the troubles of the day when tensions rise.  
      
      - Stepping out at least 30 minutes a day, five days a week not only lowers blood pressure, it helps bring down bad cholesterol and raise good cholesterol, and can even improve blood glucose levels &mdash; a boon for people battling type 2 diabetes. Just keep a brisk pace &mdash; sauntering won&rsquo;t have the same effect. 
      
      - Gaining physical and mental benefits should be motivation enough, but if your wallet wants in on the deal, it&rsquo;s good to know that walking can help ease the pinch at the gas pump. So leave your vehicle at home to do some errands &mdash; you&rsquo;ll save money and the environment to boot.

      The pigment of many veggies says something about their nutritional value: Lycopene makes tomatoes red, beta-carotene makes carrots orange, and chlorophyll makes leafy greens &hellip; green. But you can&rsquo;t always judge a vegetable by its color: pale produce offers many health benefits despite its humble hue. [Take a look][1]: 
      
      - Garlic and onions are rich in sulfur and allium, which may help manage cholesterol levels and aid immune function.  
      
      - While blacklisted from many modern diets due to their starchy, high-carbohydrate nature, potatoes are nonetheless nutrient-dense, serving as a rich source of vitamin C, folate, fiber, potassium, and a spectrum of B vitamins. Baked or roasted, not fried, is the best way to retain their nutrition.
      
      - While its cruciferous cousin, broccoli, is considered a super food, cauliflower has its own merits to boast. Rich in antioxidants, vitamin C, and folate, its fair florets can help ward off cancer and boost cardiovascular health.

      &ldquo;Since starting the KP Walk! program I&rsquo;ve lost 87 lbs., and reversed my diabetes. I encourage my coworkers to get involved with KP Walk!&rdquo; Fred Subramani, Pharmacy Clerk, Northern California.
      
      The [CDC recommends exercise like walking][1] 150 minutes a week, or 30 minutes, five days a week. The simplicity of walking is what makes it such a convenient, fun way to improve your health. It doesn&rsquo;t require any gadgets or equipment &mdash; all you need is a pair of comfortable walking shoes. But if you are looking to add more to your usual walking routine, check out these easy ways:
      
      - **Change your terrain.** If you&rsquo;re used to sidewalk paths, consider grass or sand. Not only is the softer ground kinder to your joints, it will kick your walk up a notch, so you burn more calories with each step.  
      
      - **Change your incline.** Take the stairs whenever possible, or add hills to your usual walking trail. Working against gravity taxes your heart and lower extremities, building both cardiovascular and muscle strength. 
      
      - **Change your speed.** Accelerating then slowing down your pace for small intervals helps develop stamina. 
      
      Whether you stay the course or place new demands on your efforts, as long as you walk, you&rsquo;ll continue to benefit your overall health and wellness.

      In an attempt to get more done at work, do you find yourself grabbing lunch at your desk? While it might seem like a good idea, did you know this practice increases your risk of getting sick? Desks can be busy meeting centers where germs collect, yet very few people routinely clean their desktop. And those who eat at their desks don&rsquo;t always practice [proper food safety][1]. 	
      
      Follow these simple tips to keep your lunches healthy:
      
      - **Clean it.** Wash your hands and desk surface before and after each meal. Keep hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes nearby so you can clean up spills promptly. 
      
      - **Chill it.** Refrigerate your lunch immediately when you get to work. If a refrigerator isn&rsquo;t available, put your meal in an insulated bag with an ice pack. Refrigerate leftovers promptly. 
      
      - **Heat it.** Reheat leftovers to 165 degrees.  
      
      - **Toss it.** After lunch, discard half-eaten food, disposable food packaging, and any perishable food kept at room temperature for more than two hours.	
      
      And remember, taking an actual lunch break away from your desk is considered healthy. Getting out of your workplace for a time can help you be more productive when you get back in it. If not for a meal, try to at least visit with colleagues or take walks on a regular basis to feel rejuvenated.

      - **&ldquo;Shocking&rdquo; vegetables.** This process keeps produce crisp and colorful. First, prepare a bath of cold water and ice cubes. Lightly boil or steam vegetables, such as asparagus or broccoli, and then transfer to the &ldquo;shock bath&rdquo; with a strainer or slotted spoon. To cool more quickly, stir the mixture. After they&rsquo;ve cooled, remove veggies from the water and let them dry. 
      
      - **Creating garnishes.** Practice the technique of &ldquo;chiffonade&rdquo; by cutting herbs or leafy vegetables into very thin strips to use as a gourmet garnish. Stack leaves from the largest to the smallest and form into a roll. To finely shave, use a rocking motion instead of a straight, choppy one. Patience and a [steady hand][1] are necessary. Try practicing with basil or mint leaves.
      
      - **Cutting onions.** Numerous recipes rely on onions being [diced or cut][2] into wedges, rings, or strips. Use a sharp chef&rsquo;s knife, and remember larger and firmer onions are easier to maneuver. Shave off a slice first to give you a flat, stable base. Make sure your cutting board is secured &mdash; placing a damp kitchen towel underneath the board can help.

      Fava beans have a long tradition in Mediterranean cuisine, dating back to 6,000 B.C. In fact, Italians credit the high-protein legume for saving Sicilians during a famine. Their reputation even gave them a starring role in the fairy tale &ldquo;Jack and the Beanstalk.&rdquo; Magical or not, you most certainly can benefit from the fiber, iron, antioxidants, and B vitamins found in this Old World favorite. 
      
      - Boil and mash the beans, then spread much as you would with hummus. Or pur&eacute;e the cooked favas and mix it into soups for a creamier texture.
      
      - Saut&eacute; them with other veggies like artichokes and peas, or with shrimp and thyme. 
      
      - To capitalize on their crunch, roast them and eat them like peanuts, or toss them into a garden salad. 
      
      Preparation can be time-consuming &mdash; you have to shuck and blanch fava beans in order to remove the shell and skin. But for a bean that&rsquo;s been around over 5,000 years, the effort is worth it. For a quick fix, look for fava beans in the can at specialty and health food stores.

      Dark, leafy greens are the darlings of dietitians. Chock full of vitamins A, C, K, folate, iron, and calcium, nutritionists recommend eating at least half a cup a day of these vital veggies. But their powerful nutrients also give them a strong taste that not everyone loves. So which are the most palate-pleasing?
      
      - **Kale.** Kale&rsquo;s potassium content helps regulate blood pressure, and its folic acid is particularly important for women. Sprinkle finely chopped kale into [soup][1], lasagna, and salads to upgrade vitamin levels without strongly altering flavor.
      
      - **Spinach.** Cooked spinach offers more calcium than raw spinach, so simply saut&eacute; it with garlic for a delicious, nutritious side dish. Spinach&rsquo;s mild flavor is also appetizing on pizza, in artichoke dip, and stirred into pasta dishes.  
      
      - **Swiss chard.** Often found on gourmet menus, chard&rsquo;s colorful stalks help protect your eyesight with vitamin A. It also contains blood-boosting iron. Try adding Swiss chard to your daily menu with these [ideas][2].
      
      - **Arugula.** Full of the antioxidant vitamin C, this peppery leaf gives zing to wraps, sandwiches, [salads][3], and stir-fry.
      
      Cooking with dark greens more often will help you acquire a taste for these super vegetables. Soon you&rsquo;ll be ready to [try out greens with even stronger flavors][4], like dandelion greens and collards.

      Any exercise is better than none, but 30 minutes a day will increase energy, strengthen and define muscles, and boost your immune system. In addition, regular exercise can relieve stress, reduce health risks like diabetes and heart disease, enhance mental agility, lift your mood, and keep off the pounds. Find a half hour each day with the following ideas:
      
      - **Walk when you can:** It&rsquo;s not only the greenest way to arrive, but you&rsquo;ll also save money while staying active. Consider parking a block away or getting off a few stops ahead, then walking the remaining distance.
      
      - **Use your lunch hour:** Head to the gym or take a brisk walk before you eat.
      
      - **Find the stairs:** Get in a great cardio workout without needing any special skills, equipment, or clothing.
      
      Experiment with new activities to keep your commitment fresh.

      - **Be selective.** Bruises, discoloration, and signs of overripening mean the clock is ticking. Choose fruits and veggies on the verge of their peak. Once home, if you notice soft spots or areas of deterioration, cut them away to stave off microbial decay.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Practice smart storage.** Some fruits release ethylene, which can cause sensitive veggies to decay. To keep them fresh, separate them &mdash; put veggies in the crisper drawer wrapped in paper or plastic bags, and store fruits elsewhere. Wash them when you&rsquo;re ready to eat.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Honor climate preferences.** Store bananas, avocados, eggplants, winter squash, potatoes, and tomatoes at room temperature. Do the same for citrus fruits, apples, and pears until ripe, then transfer to the fridge. Watermelon does best on the counter. Broccoli, cauliflower, leafy greens, mushrooms, root vegetables, and carrots belong in the fridge. Garlic and onions like the pantry, but green onions store better cold.\r\n\

      It&rsquo;s not easy making a change to your lifestyle &mdash; even when it brings as many perks as walking does. So the next time you&rsquo;re tempted to plop down on the couch instead of going for a walk, stop and think:
      
      - **What were the reasons you wanted to start walking?** Whether to reduce your [BMI][1], increase energy, improve your appearance, or simply carve some &ldquo;me&rdquo; time into your day, maybe those reasons have changed; if so, identify new ones. Make your health and well-being a top priority. 
      
      - **What benefits have you seen since you started walking?** They may be subtle, but if you&rsquo;ve been walking for 15 days the evidence is there. Maybe you don&rsquo;t notice that mid-afternoon slump quite so much, or your attitude is just a bit more positive. Maybe you&rsquo;re managing stress better, or your endurance has improved. 
      
      Whatever changes you&rsquo;re experiencing, remind yourself of those and take motivation from your success.

      &ldquo;If only I had a better _____, I&rsquo;d be happy.&rdquo; Whatever you&rsquo;d fill in, it&rsquo;s easy to stake happiness on external factors. However, according to [Dr. Sonya Lyubomirsky][1], genetics account for about half our personal levels of happiness; about 10 percent results from life circumstances, and about 40 percent is under conscious control. 
      
      If you&rsquo;d like to be in charge of your happiness, get started with these tips:
      
      - **Invest in relationships.** Make time for regular socializing, and show genuine interest for the people in your life.
      
      - **Speak from your heart.** [Researchers found][2] that the happiest people engage in deeper, more substantive conversation twice as often and spend 1/3 less time on small talk than the least happy. 
      
      - **Focus on experiences, not things.** A large [study][3] found that happiness increases more when people spend money on life experiences vs. possessions. 
      
      - **Think positive more than negative.** Researcher Barbara Frederickson, PhD found that [experiencing positive and negative thoughts in a 3:1 ratio][4] broadens the mind and builds inner resources and strengths. She recommends strategies like seeking out positive meaning in day-to-day life, savoring goodness, practicing gratitude as well as kindness, and doing what you truly enjoy.

The key is to pick the right ones:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Limit refined carbs.** Sugary treats and drinks, white rice, and refined pastas and breads send your blood sugar on a roller-coaster ride &mdash; taking you up, then dropping you down. And most have little nutritional value.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Boost complex carbs.** Vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains give your body a slow-burning source of energy and are dense in nutrients. That&rsquo;s ideal for keeping you on your game throughout the day.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Choose complex carbs that are high in fiber to stabilize your blood sugar, help lower your cholesterol, and keep you feeling full longer.\r\n\

      People at almost any fitness level can get a workout on a bicycle. From cycling around the neighborhood with the kids to riding over rugged mountain trails, it&rsquo;s a fun way to get fit. What&rsquo;s more, there are many alternatives to the standard bike:
      
      - **Tandem bicycles** are a treat for two. You and a partner combine forces to power the bike, letting each of you use a little less effort as you coordinate your pedaling. 
      
      - **Recumbent bicycles** include a seat that supports your back while your feet are in front of you. If you need back support, recumbent bikes might be right for you.
      
      - **3-wheelers** offer more balance and support if you&rsquo;re dealing with an injury or your weight prevents you from comfortably riding a standard bike. 
      
      - **Electric assist bicycles** are partially propelled by an electric motor, which can help you on uphill climbs or if you tire easily.
      
      - **Hand cycles** put the pedal power in the palm of your hands. They&rsquo;re a great alternative if you&rsquo;re trying to build upper-body strength or you have an injury that prevents you from riding a standard bike.

      With the barrage of dietary advice, it&rsquo;s hard to know what should be on your menu and what shouldn&rsquo;t. Keep it simple by looking at the top five ingredients on any food label. If you see these health busters, pass it up.
      
      - **Any form of sugar:** This includes high-fructose corn syrup, (which is a highly processed sugar), sucrose, agave, corn syrup, honey, evaporated cane juice, etc. Sugar raises your blood sugar without providing much nutrition, is linked with weight gain, and also adds extra calories. Sugar can show up in unexpected places &mdash; for example, it&rsquo;s one of the first ingredients in many seemingly healthy breads. 
      
      - **Trans-fats:** Trans-fats result when oils are heated and [hydrogenated][1]. These fatty acids increase LDL cholesterol and triglycerides (contributing factors for heart disease). You&rsquo;d do well to avoid any product that includes &ldquo;partially hydrogenated oils&rdquo; or &ldquo;shortening&rdquo; in its ingredients. 
      
      - **White flour (refined or enriched):** &ldquo;Refinement&rdquo; strips the whole grain of its natural nutrients. And &ldquo;enrichment&rdquo; is a way of restoring nutrients destroyed during milling, often with chemical additives. Most baked goods and breads are made with white flour; go instead for unprocessed products with whole grains.

      Here are some ways to overcome obstacles:
      
      - **Sore muscles.** A little soreness shows you&rsquo;re challenging your muscles. Go a bit slower, and warm up and cool down with gentle stretching. Getting back out there will loosen up your muscles and make them feel better. If you&rsquo;re in a lot of pain or the pain is sharp or persistent, see your doctor. 
      
      - **Feeling self-conscious.** Buy comfortable workout clothes. Tell yourself you&rsquo;re great and strong, then get out there with your head up and walk like you mean it.
      
      - **Damp weather.** There are bound to be rainy days &mdash; dress in waterproof gear and go. If it&rsquo;s too damp, hop on the treadmill or do a workout video instead.
      
      - **Stressful day.** We all have times when we just don&rsquo;t feel like it. Tune out your complaining brain while you lace up your walking shoes. Tell yourself you&rsquo;re only going down the block, then turn the corner and try another. In no time you&rsquo;ll be feeling great, relaxed, and proud of yourself for sticking with it. Aim for 150 minutes per week.
      
      Sometimes, even logging your activity online can be a challenge. Now you can log your minutes of activity on the go with the KP Walk! mobile app. Go to kpwalk.com/app on your mobile phone and download the app today.

      Stick to these three simple reminders to stay focused on healthy living.
      
      - **Eat 5:** If you shoot for at least one produce serving at each meal and two for snacks, you&rsquo;ll be on the right track. Don&rsquo;t forget to count vegetable soups, salsa, and fruit smoothies. Try tossing leafy greens with a variety of raw crops &mdash; you can get more than a serving with a produce-dense salad.
      
      - **Move 10:** On days when an hour at the gym isn&rsquo;t in the cards, try for 10 minutes. Take a walk during your lunch break, jog up to the bank, walk your child to school, or mimic jump roping in your living room as dinner cooks.
      
      - **Sleep 7-9:** Sleep deprivation can make you moody as well as prone to sickness and safety hazards like distracted driving. If you&rsquo;re under seven hours of sleep a night, try to go to bed earlier for a week. You might find the extra sleep makes you more productive.

      - **[Fish][1]:** You can&rsquo;t go wrong with saut&#233;ed spinach on the side. Or keep it simple by serving fresh, leafy greens with raspberry vinaigrette dressing. Get fancy with a medley of red peppers, cauliflower, julienne carrots, and sugar snap peas tossed with garlic and olive oil. \r\n\

      Though burying your nose in a book is a pedestrian no-no, your inner bookworm can still enjoy a good read while you walk. Listen up to these page-turning ideas:
      
      - **Book downloads.** Immerse yourself in classics, biographies, or spiritual and self-help audio books. Sites like [www.audible.com][1] and [www.learnoutloud.com][2] allow you to download books, and offer a wide selection of titles.
      
      - **Language lessons.** Sprechen sie Deutsch? You can&hellip; even as you hike throughout your neighborhood. Whether you just want to dabble in linguistics or shoot for total fluency, some foreign language programs offer apps you can install on your phone to use when you&rsquo;re on the go.
      
      - **Nature talk.** Consider importing audio tutorials about birds or flower species native to your area. Venture through a riparian preserve to enjoy an interactive exploration of the plant and animal life you hear about through your headphones.
      
      - **Radio resources.** Tune your dial to a favorite station and catch up on current events. Many stations even offer self-help shows on everything from money management to home improvement tips.

In some cases, yes. Beans, blueberries, broccoli, oats, oranges, pumpkin, salmon, soy, spinach, tea (green or black), tomatoes, turkey, walnuts, and plain yogurt top the list of super foods. Many can help [lower your cholesterol, reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer][1], and even boost your mood.\r\n\

      But that doesn&rsquo;t mean super foods are the only things you should eat.

But many doctors would say you&rsquo;re better off just stocking up on a variety of healthy foods.\r\n\

      Reinstate togetherness as a priority with a few creative techniques for incorporating fun, fitness, and family into your walking agenda.
      
      - **Generate generational gems.** Upgrade your workout by pushing little ones in a stroller through your neighborhood. Challenge preschoolers to mini-races between sign posts or to the playground. Invite older kids on a walk-and-talk to the mall or store of their choice. Or head to the library or a healthy restaurant for your final destination. Look for opportunities to bond with your kids by incorporating their interests into two-legged journeys. 
      
      - **Kindle kindred cooperation.** Pick a day to meander to a family event &mdash; such as your favorite museum or a picnic in the park. A movie theater or local sporting event can encourage even the most incorrigible teenager to join up. Or select outings that integrate walking by default &mdash; such as through a zoo, nature preserve, or river walk. If you live near where you grew up, invite your kids on a trip back in time and teach them something new about your past&hellip; and theirs.

      What would you do with more energy? Adopting high-energy habits could make a huge difference in your health and life satisfaction.
      
      In &ldquo;The Power of Full Engagement,&rdquo; authors Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz hold that &ldquo;energy, not time, is the fundamental currency of high performance.&rdquo; They teach that life involves periods of high-intensity effort, followed by rest and renewal. 
      
      Whether you want to improve your work performance or regain energy to do what you enjoy, a better balance of spending and renewing energy is essential.
      
      - Note when your energy is highest, lowest, and in between. How much time do you spend at each level during the day and throughout the week?
      
      - Identify factors that trigger periods of high and low energy for you. 
      
      - Experiment with changes to your current routine. For example, make a habit of recharging after intense physical, emotional, or mental efforts &mdash; and note the difference in your energy level.
      
      - Establish routines for everyday tasks to save energy.
      
      - Take care of yourself. Exercise regularly, eat smart, spend time connecting with friends and family members, and nourish your spirit.

      \r\n\
      - **Add fresh produce to homemade or prepared soups.** Choose low-sodium, broth-based soups, then add chopped tomatoes, green onions, snap peas, zucchini, broccoli and cauliflower tips, or other bite-sized veggies, while simmering.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Use baby spinach on sandwiches and in salads.** Lettuce has fiber and other nutrients, but it&rsquo;s not a powerhouse. Switch to spinach or other dark greens to add flavor, texture, and nutrients.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Go for a dip.** Whip up some hummus or add savory seasonings to plain yogurt to make a delicious dip. Scoop up the flavorful spread with carrots, bell pepper wedges, zucchini spears, mushrooms, and celery.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Get a head start.** Begin meals with a sizable salad and you&rsquo;re likely to eat less once you get to the main course. Just remember, if you&rsquo;re watching your calories, go easy on the dressing and hold the croutons. Add avocado with a squeeze of lime for extra flavor. \r\n\

    str: "These hand-held poles are gaining popularity among walkers and hikers; they help increase speed, lessen fatigue, and stabilize every step. Even on relatively flat ground, a pair of poles can reduce by up to half the weight and stress on your feet, legs, and lower back. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      When using trekking poles, consider:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Hand grips and wrist bands.** Poles with soft, formable hand grips can protect the area between your thumb and index fingers from calluses and blisters, while wrist bands enable you to loosen your grip and keep your hands from cramping.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Adjustable lengths.** Telescoping poles are not only convenient for storage, but also adjust to the terrain. For example, when climbing uphill, poles should be shorter than on flat terrain so you don&rsquo;t overextend your arms and shoulders; going downhill with poles that are too short, however, can strain your elbows.  \r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **The right tip.** There are three different styles of end tips: single (sharp), chiseled, or rubber. Single tipped poles are ideal for icy conditions, while poles with rubber tips are best for hard surfaces such as asphalt or cement. For an all-around trekking pole, select a chiseled tip. \r\n\

      Microwave ovens make meal preparation quick and easy, but take proper care to ensure foods stay safe to eat. Items can cook unevenly, allowing harmful bacteria to survive in &ldquo;cold spots&rdquo; that aren&rsquo;t cooked sufficiently. Prevent foodborne illness with these safe microwaving tips:
      
      - **Cook meat slowly.** Use medium power (50 percent) for larger cuts, allowing heat to reach the center gradually, without overcooking the surface.
      
      - **Spread and stir.** Arrange food evenly in the dish and stir halfway through to heat uniformly.
      
      - **Use a lid.** Cover the dish and add liquid if necessary. Moist heat aids the microwave cooking process and destroys bacteria.
      
      - **Cook thawed food promptly.** After defrosting in the microwave, cook it right away.
      
      - **Use a thermometer.** Verify food has reached a safe minimum internal temperature with a thermometer or the oven&rsquo;s temperature probe. Stay out of the &ldquo;danger zone&rdquo; by cooking food to the [safe minimum internal temperature][1].

      Whether you&rsquo;re trying to boost fitness or develop personal discipline, take a cue from the cadets by deploying these tactics:
      
      - **Strength.** Boot camp workouts incorporate traditional body-weight exercises &mdash; like push-ups, sit-ups, and squats. While free weights and other objects are used for lifts and lunges, you can drop and do 20 needing nothing more than floor space. 
      
      - **Endurance.** While you can seek out an indoor or outdoor obstacle course with military-style run-throughs, many parks and trails have their own stations along walking paths &mdash; such as pull-up bars, climbers, and raised platforms. But you can just use ramps or hills to amp up intensity, and park benches for tricep dips or incline push-ups. 
      
      - **Camaraderie.** Nothing motivates like team spirit. Find fellowship in classes where upbeat music and troop dynamics help push you to your next level. For a more intense approach, join a local [group fitness boot camp][1].
      
      There are many ways to get in the recommended 150 minutes per week of physical activity. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to try a few things to figure out what works for you.

      The way you speak to yourself profoundly affects your physical health and quality of life. Replacing negative self-talk with positive messages helps you fight headaches, colds, and chronic illness. Practice positive thinking:
      
      - **Keep track of positive and negative thoughts for a day.** Notice how positive thoughts make you feel, and intentionally reach for them.
      
      - **Perform reality checks.** Deliberately stop any negative self-talk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m no good at anything&rdquo; can be replaced with &ldquo;This task is difficult, but I&rsquo;ve learned complex things before and I&rsquo;ll learn how to do this, too.&rdquo;
      
      - **Relax.** Too much stress can trigger heart disease, diabetes, gastrointestinal problems, migraines, and depression. Find healthy ways to unwind &mdash; such as walking 30 minutes daily &mdash; and make downtime a regular part of your day.
      
      - **Use reminders.** Place positive statements where you&rsquo;ll see them every day, such as on the bathroom mirror.
      
      - **Get outside.** Deep breaths of fresh air on a summer day can float negative thoughts away. Try hiking, paddling, or simply sitting on the patio. 
      
      Think positive to boost your immune system, recover from illness, live longer, and promote overall mental and physical well-being.

      [Medical research][1] shows that a diet rich in [fiber][2] helps lowers cholesterol, encourages a healthier digestive tract, and [reduces the risk of metabolic syndrome][3], which can lead to heart disease and type 2 diabetes.
      
      Dietary fiber includes all parts of plant foods that your body can&rsquo;t digest or absorb. Soluble fiber buffers absorption of low-density lipoproteins (&ldquo;bad&rdquo; cholesterol) and slows the release of sugars. Insoluble fiber helps regulate intestinal health and aids weight control by enhancing the feeling of fullness. Eating both types of fiber aids digestion and prevents disease.
      
      Fortunately, fiber sources are plentiful and tasty this time of year.
      
      - **Put away the peeler.** The outer layers of apricots, peaches, cucumbers, zucchini, beets, eggplant, and potatoes are packed with fiber, so eat the skin.
      
      - **Snack on snap peas, green beans, and edamame.** Most anything in the legume family is a high-fiber food, and many are delicious fresh from the garden.
      
      - **Pick berries.** Summer&rsquo;s bounty abounds with fiber, thanks to the tiny seeds packed inside. A cup of raspberries or blackberries provides as much fiber as four slices of whole wheat bread. Eat them straight, or toss them into cereal, muffins, or yogurt. 
      
      Getting fiber straight from the source of fruits and vegetables is tasty, healthy, and natural. Indulge in the season&rsquo;s fresh fruits and veggies and you&rsquo;ll get the roughage your body needs for good health.

      It may be hot outside, but your body still needs a warm-up to prepare for aerobic activity, reduce injury risk, and perform well. Start your workout with low intensity warm up for the first 5-10 minutes and gradually pick up the pace to your training speed, or choose another warm-up activity such as marching in place or peddling a stationary bike.
      
      Adding [dynamic stretching movements][1] to your warm-up routine can also be useful to help you loosen up prior to exercise. Here&rsquo;s how to do it: 
      
      - **Loosen up.** Massaging a muscle that is chronically tight may increase blood flow to the muscle and help reduce tension. Gently knead the area with your hands, or use a foam roller.
      
      - **Lengthen.** Try extending body parts that may be hunched up from prolonged sitting, such as hamstrings and upper back. Move slowly and methodically, breathing as you stretch. If you feel pain, ease up and relax. Stretching shouldn&rsquo;t hurt.
      
      - **Go sideways.** Moving side-to-side engages stabilizing muscles, leading to better control and protection for when you&rsquo;re moving straight ahead. 
      
      - **Rotate.** Slowly turning your hips and shoulders can increase your mobility and core control. Stay in a range of motion that&rsquo;s comfortable. If one side feels tighter than the other, go slower and do a few more repetitions on that side.
      
      If you have the time, taking a few minutes to do a dynamic warm up may enhance your fitness and sports performance. 
      
      You can start incorporating a few minutes of activity into your life with Instant Recess. Set to music, Instant Recess is a quick, easy, and fun way to fit physical activity into your workday. Find out more on the [Healthy Workforce Website][2].

      - **Berries.** Potent polyphenols in berries may help your mind to remain agile, according to a [Tufts University study][1]. The research showed eating berry fruits enhances neurotransmission and prevents age-related mental decline.
      
      - **Apples.** A [Cornell University study][2] found that quercetin &mdash; a phytonutrient found in fresh apples &mdash; helps reduce oxidative stress that kills the nerve cells leading to cognitive degeneration. In addition, quercetin stabilizes small blood vessels to prevent stroke.  Dill, cilantro, fennel, and red onions also contain high amounts of quercetin.
      
      - **Kale.** Packed with iron, folate, and vitamins A and K, this leafy green could reduce your risk of cognitive decline, according to a study published in the [Annals of Neurology][3]. A diet rich in cruciferous vegetables &mdash; including broccoli, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts &mdash; was linked to a lower age-related decreases in mental processing and memory.
      
      Eat a variety of fresh produce to feed both your body and mind. 
      
      See if there&rsquo;s a local [Kaiser Permanente farmer&rsquo;s market][4] near you and pick up some fresh produce this week!

      Blisters, swelling, and calluses often result when sweat meets walking shoes. When mercury levels soar, use these tips to offer sweet relief for aching feet: 
      
      - **Start with a soak.** Fill a bowl with water, ice cubes, six drops of tea tree oil, and rosemary leaves. Take turns dipping each foot for 30 seconds, rubbing them vigorously with a towel between dips. To dissolve rough patches and soften skin, try a salve made with milk, honey, and orange juice. The humectants and vitamins will naturally heal cracks and seal in moisture. 
      
      - **Scrub them smooth.** Thick, callused skin can crack, leaving your feet vulnerable to pain and infection. Gently exfoliate regularly with pumice stones or a body scrub. 
      
      - **Moisturize liberally.** Choose a thick foot cream with ingredients that hydrate and soften your feet, such as petrolatum, glycerin, shea butter, or hyaluronic acid. Lotions containing urea and lactic acid also help break down calluses and smooth rough heels.
      
      Treat your feet with kindness, and they&rsquo;ll be summer walking-ready.

      MyPlate, the USDA nutrition guide, illustrates the five food groups that are building blocks for a healthy diet using a familiar image &mdash; a divided plate for a meal. Based on portioning your plate for optimal nutrition (half with vegetables and fruits, a quarter with whole grains, and a quarter with healthy protein), MyPlate recommends these [tips][1]:
      
      - Use smaller plates, bowls, and glassware to avoid oversized portions.
      - Pay attention to hunger and fullness before, during, and after meals.
      - Choose fat-free or low-fat (1 percent) milk and dairy.
      - Choose whole grains &mdash; for example, brown rice instead of white.
      - Avoid foods high in solid fats, added sugars, and salt &mdash; such as cake, cookies, ice cream, candy, sweetened drinks, pizza, and fatty meats.
      - Drink water instead of sugary beverages.
      
      Choose changes you can make today to move toward better health. In addition, know your individual daily caloric needs, stay physically active, and take a look at our [healthy eating resources][2].

      Taking advantage of summer&rsquo;s warmth by exercising outside isn&rsquo;t a personal indulgence. [Experts say][1] moving outdoors brings many mental and physical advantages. 
      
      - **Sticking with it.** Physical activity guidelines say [most adults need][2] at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity/week and muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days/week. In a [Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry study][3], participants reported greater enjoyment and satisfaction when breaking a sweat outdoors and were more likely to repeat the activity. 
      
      - **Improving mood.** The research also associated exercising in natural environments with feeling revitalized &mdash; with more energy and less tension, confusion, anger, or depression. 
      
      - **Boosting confidence.** [Outdoor recreation increases][4] self-esteem, fosters creativity, and promotes a higher sense of exhilaration, adventure, and challenge. 
      
      - **Networking socially.** The great outdoors offers social benefits, including bonding with like-minded people who enjoy nature and feeling an increased pride in your community.
      
      Go outside to keep your body, mind, and social life fit and healthy.

      Participating as a family in physical activities can be a fun way to spend time together and get everyone moving. Kids and adults who feel supported by families to become active are more likely to engage in healthy behaviors. Foster a [healthy level of activity][1] with these tips:
      
      - **Facilitate.** Organize a safe walk to and from neighborhood sites a few times a week. 
      
      - **Share.** Involve everyone in doing chores, gardening, and yard work. While you&rsquo;re all moving, you&rsquo;ll feel a sense of mutual accomplishment and teamwork. 
      
      - **Discuss.** [Congregate the family weekly][2] to plan activities, recognize achievements, and solve problems. Family meetings strengthen bonds and helps you stay connected. Keep them lively by gathering someplace fun and active, like a local park or miniature golf course.
      
      - **Participate.** Volunteer to help with afterschool physical activity programs or sports teams. Give children toys that encourage physical activity, like balls and kites, and play with them. 
      
      - **Move.** More fitness means more energy, so combine family fun with being physically active whenever possible. Visit the zoo, go roller-skating, or take a hike together.
      
      Your active participation will help build strong family bonds and ensure a healthy future. Check out these [resources][3] for additional ways to reduce stress and maintain a health work/life balance.

      Summer-ripe fruit is especially delicious &mdash; and a nutritional powerhouse. For the biggest impact, aim for different colors and varieties throughout the day.
      
      - **Breakfast.** A slice of sweet honeydew is a great accompaniment to a whole wheat English muffin. Enjoy chopped peaches or nectarines in plain low-fat yogurt. Top oatmeal or whole grain cereal with blueberries.
      
      - **Lunch.** Toss your salad with strawberries, pomegranate seeds, or grapes. Add sliced apples or pears to a turkey, ham, or peanut butter sandwich.
      
      - **Snack.** For a cooling twist, freeze grapes, melon balls, or raspberries.
      
      - **Dinner.** Mango or peach salsa makes a delicious topping for fish or chicken. For a side dish, try a brown rice salad with diced apricots, cucumber, and red bell pepper, which are all botanically fruits.
      
      - **Dessert.** As a sweet ending to your meal, almost any fruit will do. [Grilling fruit][1] brings out more of its natural sweetness and makes an elegant dessert.
      
      Getting your two or more daily servings may be easier than you think. [A serving of fruit][2] equals one cup of diced pineapple or melon, about 8 strawberries, 32 grapes, 1 peach, or 2 plums.

      Cardiovascular and muscle endurance are key components of physical fitness. 
      
      - **Cardiovascular endurance** is the ability to deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues and remove waste over sustained time. [Aerobic exercise][1] is associated with weight control, stronger immunity, and improved mental well-being. This type of exercise includes walking, swimming, bicycling, and rowing.
      
      - **Muscle endurance** is the ability of muscles to sustain repeated contractions or continue applying force against a fixed object. Strength training is linked with stronger bones, weight control, better mood, and easier management of chronic conditions. Do your summer training outdoors for [muscle conditioning moves][2] like tree limb pull-ups and park bench dips.
      
      Following these fitness principles from the President&rsquo;s Council on Fitness, Sports, & Nutrition can help you build endurance:
      
      - **Specificity.** Train for the activity you&rsquo;re interested in. For instance, if want to become a stronger swimmer, focus on training the muscles required in the water. 
      
      - **Overload.** To see improvement, work out at levels vigorous and long enough to challenge your body.
      
      - **Progression.** Gradually increase the intensity, frequency, and/or duration of activity over time.
      
      Exercise safely and give yourself time to recover. If you haven&rsquo;t been active in awhile, consult with your doctor before beginning a new fitness program.

      Fresh perspective injects energy and new life into just about anything, even your daily walk. When you&rsquo;re close to home, try viewing your everyday surroundings through the eyes of a tourist, and you might see some of the same places in a whole new light. Join a local walking tour, [find trails][1], or stop by a visitor center for highlights of local flavor, including:
      
      - **Architecture.** From rough stone to smooth steel, different structures reflect a town&rsquo;s timeline. Humble dwellings, public buildings, and skyscrapers all tell their own stories.
      
      - **Gardens.** Many towns have lush, colorful niches that offer welcome pit stops for walkers. Neighborhoods that host garden tours reliably offer stunning foliage, as they&rsquo;re typically populated by greener thumbs. 
      
      - **Landmarks.** Bronze plaques and monuments don&rsquo;t adorn every historical landmark. You can bet there are plenty famous, infamous, or almost-famous sites in the area. Check the library or historical society for information about local lore and spice up your walks with a bit of history. 
      
      When you walk with new eyes, rich history and sublime beauty are often only footsteps away.

      - **Practice mindful living.** When someone speaks, truly listen. When you have something to share, focus on the one you&rsquo;re sharing it with. \r\n\

      - **Keep it fresh.** Make time for fun activities and sharing new and exciting experiences regularly. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be big &mdash; even trying a new restaurant or walking a new route together can do the job. Adding humor, such as telling comical stories or coming to the dinner table wearing fake glasses and mustache, can help a marriage survive a rough time.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Make a point of connecting with family daily.** Mealtime chats and playing together are excellent ways to stay in touch. Catch up over an iced tea, an after-dinner walk, or during a drive.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Show kindness and appreciation.** Doing little things for each other is simple, and kindness is contagious. Your kind words, thank yous, and sweet gestures will spur similar behaviors in others.  \r\n\

      Fresh fruits and vegetables don&rsquo;t come with an expiration date, so how do you choose? Here are a few simple tricks:
      
      - **Feel it.** Choose firm asparagus, garlic, pears, potatoes, and Brussels sprouts. Select slightly soft peaches, plums, and avocados.
      
      - **Smell it.** Ripe cantaloupes, lemons, and tomatoes give off sweet scents that you can&rsquo;t mistake. Unripe fruits usually don&rsquo;t smell, but your nose can often detect if they&rsquo;re overripe or rotten.
      
      - **Look it over.** Spinach, lettuce, celery, parsley, kale, and broccoli should be green, evenly colored, and crisp-looking. Carrots, strawberries, beets, potatoes, and yams should have an attractive color, taut skin, and smooth appearance. Check for mold and insect holes.
      
      - **Judge its weight.** The tastiest watermelons, grapefruits, and eggplants feel heavy for their size.
      
      - **Buy it in season.** Produce that&rsquo;s out of season comes from farther away, and generally lacks the flavor of in-season crops.
      
      Whether from a grocery store, farmers&rsquo; market, or roadside stand, know how to buy the best, so you get the most for your money.

      Protection and hydration are priorities in the summer months &mdash; prime season for heatstroke, sunburn, and dehydration. When temperatures rise and layers come off, beat the heat with comfortable and cooling apparel, such as:
      
      - **The right shoes.** Buy new walking shoes at the end of the day, when feet tend to swell. Wear your walking socks when you try them on, so you&rsquo;ll have the right fit. Walking shoes don&rsquo;t typically break in like many other shoes, so if they&rsquo;re not comfortable in the store, keep looking.
      
      - **Synthetics.** Cotton/synthetic blends (or pure synthetic) socks, underwear, and clothing wick moisture away from your skin, keeping your body and feet dryer than pure cotton. Look for orlon, nylon, and polypropylene on the label.
      
      - **Head protection.** Hats with a brim shade your eyes, face, and scalp from the sun. Look for back flaps to shield your neck. Some hats have cooling, polymer-filled headbands that accelerate wicking and feel soothing against your head.
      
      Today&rsquo;s advanced fitness wear makes it easier than ever to suit up and walk cooler, no matter how hot the temperature.

      Learning to preserve food properly can save time and money. Here are three popular methods:
      
      - **[Drying][1]:** Dried foods are tasty, nutritious, and lightweight, which makes them perfect for camping trips and on-the-go snacks. Select fresh, ripe fruits and veggies for drying, and trim away any bruised spots. Cut to about 1/4-inch slices and peel the skins. Prehydration treatments such as sulfite solutions can prevent oxidation (which removes flavor, color, and vitamins).
      
      - **[Canning][2]:** Canning your own fruits and vegetables saves cash, helps the environment, and rewards you with a supply of delicious, nutritious food. Be sure to follow instructions &mdash; improperly canned food can contain the deadly botulism toxin, even without showing signs of spoilage. For store-bought canned goods, &ldquo;sell by&rdquo; and &ldquo;use by&rdquo; dates are accurate only if stocked where temperatures don&rsquo;t fluctuate.
      
      - **[Freezing][3]:** If frozen at peak quality, thawed foods emerge with their nutrients and flavor intact. Frozen items should be kept at 0 degrees F. Once thawed, they should be handled as any perishable food. Produce with high water content (tomatoes, greens, and berries) will freeze safely, but when thawed, their typically suitable only for cooking or blending.
      
      Whether you grow your own or support a local farmers&rsquo; market, discover the year-round benefits of preserving the season&rsquo;s bounty.

      Literally &ldquo;People&rsquo;s March,&rdquo; volksmarching originated in Germany as a personal fitness and recreation program that offers noncompetitive walking events. Most volksmarchers begin walking for fitness, but continue because of other perks, including:
      
      - **Camaraderie.** The relaxed nature of volksmarching lends itself to conversation. You&rsquo;ll meet people and make new friends at volksmarching events. Even two or three generations of families may gather for a volksmarching weekend.
      
      - **Culture.** The art of walking belongs to volksmarching, with local historic and scenic routes across the country being typical options.
      
      - **Countryside.** Walking routes through parks, past waterfalls, and along mountain trails lets you discover beautiful places off the beaten path.

      Do you wake up with a sense of eagerness, ready to grab hold of the day? If you feel burned out and weary more often than energized and fulfilled, it&rsquo;s time to make some changes.  
      
      - **Pinpoint your passions.** What kind of work, hobby, or other activity is so interesting and fun for you that you lose track of time doing it? Intentionally spend time this week on things that make you happy. 
      
      - **Play every day.** Working hard at your job is important, but enjoying some carefree, unstructured time is essential for well-being. Tinker with model airplanes or paint watercolor landscapes. If it makes you smile, you&rsquo;re on the right track.
      
      - **Rest well.** Sleep deprivation robs you of energy and makes even small stresses seem big. Most adults need 7-9 hours of sleep to wake up well rested.

      With dozens of different lettuces to choose from, you can make a different type of salad every day, continually enjoying varied flavors and key nutrients. Here are some salad greens to savor:
      
      - **Arugula.** The peppery tang of arugula gives salad a little kick. It also adds iron, magnesium, copper, potassium, vitamins A, C, K, and folic acid. Also try raw arugula tossed on top of a hot pizza or mixed into a [red potato salad][1].
      
      - **Green and red leaf.** Loaded with vitamins A and K, beta carotene, and lutein, green leaf lettuce is a solid antioxidant with a mild, delicate flavor. Reddish pigment in the leaves provides antioxidants and a slight sweetness.
      
      - **Radicchio.** The mildly bitter flavor of radicchio adds a bite to other mixed greens. Nutritionally, it offers vitamins A and C as well as potassium, calcium, and iron.
      
      - **Romaine.** The crispy freshness of romaine lettuce is the foundation for a [great Caesar salad][2]. It also provides beta-carotene, folate, and vitamins A and C.
      
      - **Spinach.** A nutritional powerhouse, spinach is packed with iron, calcium, and zinc. Mixing garden-fresh spinach into your dish of vegetables adds an earthy undertone.
      
      Salad is known as a meal starter, but a well-rounded salad can be a meal in itself. Get started by checking out the [B.Y.O.S. Toolkit][3]. Sharing a meal is a great way to build your team&rsquo;s camaraderie while eating delicious, healthy food.

      Exercise is important for your health and well-being. But if you don&rsquo;t enjoy what you&rsquo;re doing, you may not stick with it. Try these ideas:
      
      - **Find activities you like.** Sports, classes, and exercises that match your needs and interests will help you keep up your healthy habit for life. 
      
      - **Alter your routine.** Varying your workout can make it more intellectually stimulating while improving your total fitness. Alternate between activities such as walking, cycling, swimming, aerobic dance, or using exercise machines. Make [cross-training][1] part of your program for well-rounded conditioning and less monotony.
      
      - **Remind yourself of your motivation.** Are you looking to improve your overall health? Manage a chronic condition? Whatever your reasons, remember them often to keep you moving. Give yourself achievable goals, like preparing for a 5K race or fitting into your old jeans, and track your progress.
      
      - **Recruit a companion.** If it&rsquo;s hard to push yourself, perhaps a little team spirit will do the trick. Meet a friend for a daily walk, or ask someone to try a new sport with you. Find fellowship in a [group exercise program][2] where a knowledgeable instructor and like-minded people will keep you going.
      
      Exercise is an act of will as much as it is an act of the body. Stay determined with diverse activities, a fun atmosphere, and challenges you can meet.

      With grilling season in full swing, ignite these habits to keep your sizzling dishes both delicious and healthy:
      
      - **Choose [leaner cuts][1].** For beef or pork, these usually include &ldquo;round&rdquo; or &ldquo;loin&rdquo; in their names. For example, select flank steak, sirloin tip, tenderloin, and top round for beef; and center loin, tenderloin, and Canadian bacon for pork. For poultry, choose boneless, skinless, white meat. Try seafood on the grill like trout, salmon, or shrimp skewers with bell peppers and onions.
      
      - **Decrease carcinogens.** Marinating or rubbing spices on meat before cooking adds flavor and [may reduce dangerous carcinogens][2]. Aim for a half-cup of marinade or one tablespoon of spice rub for each pound.
      
      - **Go meatless! Give non-meats a chance.** Many veggies and fruits are grill worthy, including tomatoes, mushrooms, bell peppers, pineapple, onion, nectarines, and yellow squash. To [prevent burning][3], sear over high heat and finish cooking on a cooler spot of the grill.
      
      Remember to clean your grill often and cook food thoroughly. For more tips, visit the [Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics website][4].

      Warm weather lets you explore new destinations on your walks. Consider setting foot on these summer hot spots:
      
      - **The beach.** Enjoy glistening ripples and crashing waves while basking beneath the sun&rsquo;s warm glow. Walking on sand also adds fun and intensity to your walk. Reminders from the CDC: Protect your skin with a UVA/UVB sunscreen of 15 or higher SPF and wear your sunglasses plus a hat. Keep your shoes on to walk on firm sand near the water; it&rsquo;s easier on the tendons and ligaments. 
      
      - **Hiking trails.** Follow blazed paths through scenic natural surroundings while breathing the fresh air. For unfamiliar terrain or a lengthy trail, bring a walking partner, map, cell phone, and plenty of water. Online tools such as [Every Trail][1] and [All Trails][2] can help you find nearby paths. 
      
      No matter where you go, regular activity strengthens your heart and lowers blood pressure and cholesterol. Keep exploring as you aim to be active for the recommended 150 minutes or more per week. In addition to staying active for your health, you can get a personalized action plan today by taking the Total Health Assessment at [kp.org/hwf][3].

      &ldquo;I have figured out that since I automatically wake up early in the morning, instead of laying in bed squeezing my eyes tight because I don&rsquo;t want to get up, I can make the most of that time.

      With an average high of 84.4 degrees F, August ranks as the nation&rsquo;s second-hottest month. But don&rsquo;t let that stop you from being active&hellip; just remember some safeguards.
      
      - **Hydrate.** Drink water before, during, and after each exercise session. If you are active in warm weather for longer than 45 minutes, consider drinking fluids containing electrolytes (sodium, potassium, glucose) while you exercise to replenish what you lose through perspiration. 
      
      - **Dress.** On hot and sunny days, wear loose clothes that wick sweat from your body. Avoid dark attire &mdash; it absorbs more sunlight and heat.
      
      - **Ease up when necessary.** When it&rsquo;s too hot or humid, you can walk instead of run, go half your typical distance or half your typical pace. Try walking 15 minutes twice a day to get in 30 minutes of activity.
      
      If you&rsquo;re uncomfortable or unaccustomed to exercising in hot weather, visit a gym or mall to get your steps in while staying cool.

      Maintaining a [healthy blood pressure level][1] can lower your risk of heart and kidney disease, stroke, and vision loss. Being physically active is an important key, and aerobic activities such as these can help:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Walking.** In addition to improving blood pressure, walking can lower cholesterol, increase glucose tolerance, and enhance insulin sensitivity. Aim to walk briskly for 30 minutes a day, five days a week. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Cycling.** Around the neighborhood, through a park, on a vacation adventure &mdash; bikes can take you almost anywhere. Or stay indoors by pedaling stationary bikes at the gym or home. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Swimming.** For a cardiovascular workout that&rsquo;s friendly on joints, take a dip. A [study][2] found that swimming 15\xE2\x80\x9345 minutes a day for 3\xE2\x80\x934 days a week lowered systolic blood pressure by about 9 points. \r\n\

      - The total health assessment (THA) is voluntary and confidential and can help you understand how behavior affects health. 
      
      - The THA is a quick and easy online tool that in just 20-30 minutes creates a health action plan just for you. The program uses your answers to create a personalized action plan with steps you can take to improve or maintain your health.
      
      - If you &ldquo;know your numbers&rdquo; &mdash; such as your cholesterol &mdash; you&rsquo;ll get an even more customized plan. However, you don&rsquo;t need this information to get personalized action steps. 
      
      - Even if you completed the THA last year, it is recommended you take it again this year. Taking the THA again provides the opportunity to see your progress, celebrate accomplishments, and take the next step on your health journey.

      - **Before working out.** Avoid high-calorie fare about two hours before exercising. Choose easily digestible foods such as apples, bananas, grapes, juice, or whole grain toast.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **After working out.** If your workout is vigorous and lasts longer than 90 minutes, refuel with protein and carbs to nourish your muscles. Protein combos can include hummus and whole wheat pita or turkey and cheese. Smart carbs include whole wheat pasta, whole wheat rice, and low-fat yogurt.\r\n\

      - **Stepping.** Hit the ground heel first, roll your foot forward, and then push off with your toes. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Alignment.** Walk tall. Keep your spine long by lifting up off your hips; open up your chest muscles by pulling your shoulders back and down, keeping them level; and engage your core by pulling your bellybutton in towards your spine. Make sure your hips stay aligned by keeping your buttocks in.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Arms and eyes.** Bend your elbows at 90 degrees. Swing your arms forward and back. Your head should be upright, with your eyes gazing 10\xE2\x80\x9320 feet ahead. \r\n\

      Your food choices can help you have a healthy BMI. Try these tips: 
      
      - **Balance your plate.** [USDA guidelines][1] recommend portioning your plate for optimal nutrition. Fill half your dish with vegetables and fruits, a quarter with whole grains, and a quarter with healthy protein. 
      
      - **Check for added sugar.** The [American Heart Association recommends][2] limiting added sugar to no more than 100 calories a day for women and 150 calories a day for men. Cut back on foods with these added sugars on the [ingredient list][3]: brown sugar, corn sweetener, corn syrup, dextrose, fructose, fruit juice concentrate, glucose, high-fructose corn syrup, honey, invert sugar, lactose, maltose, molasses, raw sugar, sucrose, syrup, and table sugar. 
      
      - **Load up on vegetables.** Aim for 5-9 servings of vegetables a day in a variety of vivid colors &mdash; dark green, red, yellow/white, blue/purple, and orange.

      At some level, stress is part of everyday life. But by taking a half-full approach your outlook can remain cheery during adversity:

      Kick off the month with a healthy good time. Labor Day offers the best of summer, including backyard fun until dark. So even if you can&rsquo;t devote the whole day to outdoor exercise, join a volleyball tournament, chase a badminton birdie, or fling a Frisbee&#174;. Even push-mowing the lawn provides enough intensity to boost fitness and well-being. To make sure your activity counts toward better health, hit these two goals:
      
      - **Heart pumping.** Moderate exercise makes your heart rate rise so that you&rsquo;re breathing harder, but you can still have a conversation. 
      
      - **Meeting your totals.** Keep your heart rate up for at least 10 minutes. Opt for lively, nonstop games, such as soccer over horseshoes. And strive for 30 minutes a day or 15 minutes twice a day, five days a week.
      
      Get moving and you&rsquo;ll set the stage for a happy, healthy month. Learn more about how to incorporate activity into your day. Join us for our Active Living Webinars at the Learning Forum. [Click to register][1] for the September 15 and 17 sessions.

      Some people naturally have a no-worries attitude. What&rsquo;s the secret? It&rsquo;s all in how you view and respond to problems.

To get a new view, try these ideas: 
      
      - **[Volunteer][1].** Visit with someone at a retirement home or homeless shelter. Trading stories is a time-tested technique, whether they&rsquo;re about historic battles or everyday living. 
      
      - **Meet and greet.** Introduce yourself to a neighbor. You might find a friendly ear to bend right on your block.
      
      - **Attend a library or museum talk.** Events typically include authors, artists, and local activists, providing a wide variety of insights.

      You know when it leaps, when it aches, and when it&rsquo;s on your sleeve, but do you know what your heart does at work? Check out these fascinating facts:
      
      - **It&rsquo;s electric.** A small, natural electrical current starts each essential heartbeat.
      
      - **It&rsquo;s tireless.** Your heart beats about 100,000 times per day.
      
      - **It&rsquo;s strong.** The size of two fists put together, this mega-muscle pumps five quarts of blood per minute.
      
      - **It&rsquo;s reactive.** The muscle is so resilient that starting an exercise program can give long-term heart benefits even if you&rsquo;ve never exercised much before.
      
      So take care of your ticker. Find an [American Heart Association][1] heart walk near you. Exercise to help lower triglycerides and raise your HDL (good) cholesterol levels. [Know your numbers][2] and pair your fitness plan with [heart-healthy food choices][3].

      Everybody appreciates a treat at work for birthdays, milestones, and other special days. You can avoid the downside (including unhealthy trans-fats and excess sugar) by choosing delicious new traditions: 
      
      - **Nature&rsquo;s candy.** [Fresh fruit desserts][1] are fun and full of healthy antioxidants. Try blueberries or pineapple over frozen yogurt.
      
      - **Peppy popcorn.** Fire up the air-popper for bowls brimming with slightly [spicy homemade popcorn][2].  
      
      - **Festive smoothies.** Set up a mix-and-match blender bar. Start with nonfat plain yogurt or almond milk and provide add-ins such as mango, banana, cucumber, strawberries, and kale.
      
      - **Salsa social.** Have everyone bring a signature salsa for a fruit-and-veggie fiesta. Baby carrots, squash slices, and bell peppers make great dippers as do baked beet chips.

      &ldquo;Started wearing my pedometer every day. It&rsquo;s amazing to see the steps and miles add up. I get a weekly email report that shows what I&rsquo;ve done. All I can say is one thing that helps me at work are the stairs. Unless my hands are full, I take them up and/or down. I also park at the end when I am doing my errands, like grocery shopping yesterday. I have to say, more activity plus gym time has really helped me shed 40 pounds!&rdquo; Rebecca Sims, Patient Care Coordinator Assistant, Northern California.
      
      Finding your fitness groove is a great feeling. So is incorporating something different now and then. Try a fun change:
      
      - **Go for an evening walk.** Tonight is the full harvest moon &mdash; don&rsquo;t miss this inspiring spotlight. Before electric lights, people commonly walked at night by moon glow. Or maybe you prefer pre-dawn quiet. Just remember to wear reflective clothing, and consider safety gear such as a headlamp, personal alarm, or walking stick.
      
      - **Blast your brain.** Queue up an informative [TED Talks][1] playlist about physics, film, medical advances, or one of many other fascinating topics. 
      
      - **Feel the rush.** [Experts][2] say the most beneficial walking pace is brisk, as if you&rsquo;re late for an appointment. So put the rush to work for you, or just imagine you&rsquo;re running a little behind to pick up the pace for short bursts during your daily 30-minute walks.
      
      Change up your routine and make your walk the highlight of your day. Learn more about how to incorporate activity into your day. Join us for our Active Living Webinars at the Learning Forum. [Click to register][3] for the September 15 and 17 sessions.

      Achievement nourishes mind and spirit &mdash; so make a goal and go get it. It doesn&rsquo;t take a big project to give you a major uplift. A few ideas&hellip;  
      
      - **Adopt a new hobby.** Pick up a model plane kit or learn to knit. Take guitar lessons or try refinishing furniture.
      
      - **Study a skill.** Some skills only take a short time to learn, but months to master. Juggling, golf, and sailing are just a few engaging pastimes that become more rewarding as you practice.
      
      - **Do it yourself.** Seeing your handiwork on display is a pick-me-up. Why not learn to paint a picture or build a birdhouse? Or take on a challenge such as changing your car&rsquo;s oil or tiling the floor.
      
      Trade screen time for a fun challenge and feel your gratification soar.

      These underused ingredients pack big flavor in small amounts and can be added to all kinds of meals.
      
      - **Worcestershire sauce.** It&rsquo;s special blend provides &ldquo;the fifth taste&rdquo; &mdash; a category other than sweet, sour, salty, or bitter&hellip; called umami &mdash; for satisfying savor. Just a splash perks up grilled veggies and spaghetti sauce. It&rsquo;s also a key ingredient in [homemade Caesar dressing][1].

      Stronger muscles around your stomach, back, and pelvis mean better balance, stability, and posture as well as pain relief. Consider adding a few minutes of [standing core exercises][1] to your 30 minutes a day, five days a week active schedule. Choose a challenge:\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Knee lift.** Stand straight with hands out to the sides for balance. Lift one knee to make your thigh nearly parallel with the floor, then lower your foot back to the floor. Repeat 10 times, then switch legs.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Side leg lift.** Stand with hands on hips, then lift one leg straight out to the side, aiming to raise your foot six inches off the floor. Then slowly lower and repeat on same side for 10 repetitions. Switch legs.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Pli&eacute;.** Stand with feet wider than hips. Turn toes outward, keeping your hands on your thighs. Bend knees and sink pelvis slightly toward the floor, then raise back to starting position. Repeat 10 times.\r\n\

      Abraham Lincoln famously said, &ldquo;If I had six hours to chop down a tree, I&rsquo;d spend the first four hours sharpening the axe.&rdquo; Twentieth century organizational expert Stephen Covey also touted [&ldquo;sharpening the saw&rdquo;][1] as a way to reach peak personal efficiency. Next time you feel you&rsquo;re working with a blunt axe and getting nowhere, try one of these techniques to regroup: 
      
      - **Tidy up.** [Research][2] finds that neat surroundings lead to healthier choices. Spend a few minutes reducing visual clutter at your workspace and you&rsquo;ll also get a mental lift.
      
      - **Take a moment.** Give yourself a full minute outside the bustle to just breathe. Mentally put distracting thoughts into a box. Or use the [One Moment Meditation][3] before and after challenges to re-center and prepare yourself for the next task. 
      
      Just as a healthy snack boosts your body, a mental refuel can refresh your spirit and help you stay positive.

      - **Lettuce begin.** Start by growing your own mesclun mix in a backyard plot or balcony [Salad Box&trade;][2]. Sow nutrient superstars including spinach, kale, and arugula along with red and green leaf lettuce. These cool weather plants will produce for months to come.
      
      - **Clip early and often.** Snip outer leaves and the plants will continue to grow from the center. Also harvest a few 2-leaf microgreens, which [offer more nutrition][3] than full-grown plants, such as red cabbage and Swiss chard. 
      
      - **Dress for success.** Use heart-healthy oils (try olive, flax, or walnut) in a [homemade vinaigrette][4]. Or drizzle on a [garlic and yogurt dressing][5] for probiotic and antioxidant benefits.

      - **Batter up.** Get into batting stance with feet apart and knees slightly bent. Now swing that invisible bat, aiming for a big hit.
      
      - **Power pitch.** Wind up and let loose your best curveball. 
      
      - **Make the call.** Copy umpire moves with arms. Start in a slight squat. Then put some personality into signals such as crossing your arms in front then out to the sides to indicate &ldquo;safe&rdquo; or a big arm jab to say &ldquo;you&rsquo;re out!&rdquo;
      
      - **Do the wave.** Bend knees, then straighten and put arms up in the classic cheer.

      - Herbs such as rosemary, oregano, and thyme can go into freezer bags after a simple rinse and pat dry. Chop or crumble frozen leaves into your favorite recipes.
      
      - Blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and other juicy favorites should be spread on a tray to freeze. Once firm, seal in bags to use later in desserts, smoothies, or cereal.
      
      - Bell peppers &mdash; de-seeded and sliced or chopped &mdash; can be spread on a tray to harden before transferring to freezer bags. Jalapenos or other hot peppers can be dropped into a zip-top bag whole.

      Yoga offers benefits for building muscles, improving flexibility, [lowering blood pressure][1], and feeling your best. Yet first-timers may be nervous about attending a class. Put your mind at ease:
      
      - **You don&rsquo;t need a special mat or clothing.** Bring a towel to spread on the floor. Wear something you can move in (athletic pants or shorts, and a  T-shirt or tank). 
      
      - **You won&rsquo;t need to chant.** Typical yoga classes focus only on breathing and body postures. Although yoga is not a religion, it does encourage a mind-body connection.
      
      - **You don&rsquo;t need to be Gumby.** Flexibility is something you gain at your own pace. Even the most rubbery yogis say it&rsquo;s a practice &mdash; and they learn more each time.
      
      - **Yoga is for everyone.** Even NFL players use yoga. Rock singers, grandmothers, executives, and school kids all participate.

      - **Say thanks.** Tell a coworker or store assistant and manager how helpful they were. Or send a (now-rare) handwritten letter.
      
      - **Do only one thing.** It&rsquo;s easy to lose sight of simple good fortunes. So focus on the moment. Sipping coffee? Hearing birdsong? Stop multi-tasking and appreciate small gifts, if just for 60 seconds.
      
      [Explore more ways][2] to care for your well-being. It takes just a few mindful moments to multiply happiness.

      Sometimes the oldest advice turns out to be the best. Recent [Oxford University research][1] suggests eating an apple a day can have a heart-healthy effect similar to statin drugs, reducing LDL (bad) cholesterol. It&rsquo;s just another reason to love this fall fruit: 
      
      - **Buy local.** Autumn is the perfect time to go picking or buy a bushel. Find a nearby orchard at [www.pickyourown.org][2]. You may also discover surprising variety beyond Red Delicious and Granny Smith, such as Honey Crisp, Fuji, Pink Lady, and Ruby Frost.
      
      - **Stock up.** Many apple cultivars keep well for several months in a refrigerator or cool basement. Check [this guide][3] or your local [agricultural extension office][4] for storage times.

      Communing with critters can be good motivation to move more. Those who own dogs are more likely to walk daily, be tobacco-free, and have lower cholesterol and reduced stress. But you don&rsquo;t have to own a pet to get animal inspiration. Find a [volunteer project][1] to:
      
      - **Horse around.** Walk horses at a therapeutic riding center.
      
      - **Wag the dog.** Give shelter dogs some time outside or even a much-needed game of chase. 
      
      - **Go wild.** Head to a park to help clean up green spaces. Spy songbirds and woodland creatures along the way.
      
      There&rsquo;s something about furry or feathered friends that puts pep in your step and helps make a healthy new habit even happier.

      Crisp fall days call for soup. You can stuff so many veggies in a soup that getting your daily servings will be a breeze. Customize these flavor profiles to build your own one-pot power meal. 
      
      - **Gorgeous green.** Kale, spinach, collards, beet greens, and other leafy leaders can be cooked in broth then pureed to become a tasty base for white beans, potatoes, brown rice, or cauliflower. Start with this [basic recipe][1] and add what you like.
      
      - **Black bean bonanza.** Using dried beans makes [this soup][2] economical and lower in sodium than canned. Peppers are a natural match; carrots, diced winter squash, and shredded cabbage also add nutrient-rich color.
      
      - **Hearty turkey vegetable.** Trade traditional beef stock for turkey to reduce fat and create this [flavorful broth][3] chock-full of root veggies and heart-smart barley.
      
      Another stirring idea: Start a soup group at work to trade samples.

      Make your own motivation: A University of [New Hampshire study][1] showed that positive exercising memories heightened internal drive, resulting in increased activity sessions. Some ways to create positive memories: 
      
      - **Joke** with a fitness buddy during your 30-minute walk. You&rsquo;ll be even more likely to keep an exercise date if it&rsquo;s the only time you get to spend with that particular pal.
      
      - **Savor** the gorgeous sunset during an evening walk. 
      
      - **Make notes** of your progress and watch the numbers change week after week. 
      
      And don&rsquo;t forget &mdash; you&rsquo;ll be doing friends and coworkers a favor by reminding them how great you all felt after your last exercise session.

      As you gear up for a new month, prepare to start every morning on a positive note. In just 20 minutes, you&rsquo;ll be ready to win the day.
      
      - **First four minutes.** Get a healthy dose of the best medicine: laughter. Read a few pages of a comic anthology (consider *The Far Side*&#174; or *Calvin & Hobbes*) for a quick giggle. Or visit a favorite funny website to start the day smiling.
      
      - **Head out for 15.** Fit in a quick walk to increase natural stress-fighting endorphins and boost your mood. (Remember to schedule another 15 minutes later to reach your 30-minute recommended daily goal.)
      
      - **Final minute.** Take some deep breaths and repeat a personal affirmation such as &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in control&rdquo; or &ldquo;Go get it!&rdquo; [One Moment Meditation][1] is also a great day-starter.

      Whether you&rsquo;re a walking rookie or authority on the asphalt, it&rsquo;s a good idea to have a clear objective like a time to beat, a distance to cover, or an event to complete. Celebrate your success in the form of a reward, such as:
      
      - **New gear.** If you&rsquo;ve been putting up with a worn-out pair of workout shoes, buy a new pair with fresh insoles, a clean exterior, and unworn treads. 
      
      - **Fresh beats.** [Studies][1] show that music can be a stellar motivator. It elevates mood, increases endurance, and distracts from pain and fatigue. But make sure your volume is low enough to hear traffic and other pedestrians. For safety, always remain aware of your surroundings. Download some favorites, and gear up for your next goal.
      
      - **A get-together.** Share your success with family and friends and let them see how good you feel. You might pick up a walking partner as a result.
      
      Choose your next achievement and walk toward it with confidence.

      If your to-do list is crowding out fitness goals, it&rsquo;s time to get creative. Even if you&rsquo;re busy, finding time to walk 30 minutes a day, five days a week isn&rsquo;t hard, especially if you break it up into two slots a day.
      
      Use these tips to carve a little space for walking:
      
      - **Take a post-dinner trek.** Skip dessert, grab a partner, and head out for a brisk walk in the autumn night air. 
      
      - **Enjoy the treadmill and a show.** Watch your favorite show for 30 minutes as you walk on a treadmill. As the sun sets earlier and nights get colder, treadmill workouts can keep you on the go when the weather doesn&rsquo;t cooperate.
      
      - **Use the stairs.** Take stairs whenever possible. When you reach your floor, go back down and do one more circuit&hellip; two if you can. 
      
      As busy as you may be, your body will thank you if you keep walking on your daily schedule.

      It may seem contrary to common sense, but consuming bacteria can be a good thing. Also known as &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; or &ldquo;good&rdquo; bacteria, probiotics are live microorganisms similar to the beneficial ones found in our digestive tracts. [Research][1] suggests a host of benefits, including allergy resistance, improved brain function, and better digestive health. If you&rsquo;re considering probiotics, remember these tips:
      
      - **Check out food sources.** Probiotics are available in many food items. For example, look for a &ldquo;live, active cultures&rdquo; label on yogurt and kefir, miso, tempeh, and fermented vegetables like sauerkraut or kimchi.
      
      - **Read labels.** When buying probiotic foods, still examine and compare nutrition labels for reduced fat and reasonable amounts of sugar.
      
      - **Ask about supplements.** Check with your doctor for recommendations.
      
      Combined with a nutritious diet, probiotics can be an important health weapon.

      Perhaps your walking routine suits you just fine. But imagine the thrill of completing a race &mdash; the crinkle of paper pinned to your back, throngs of supporters cheering you on for that glorious finish line, and most important, the satisfaction of a walk or run well done. Here are some reasons to make that fantasy a reality:
      
      - **You&rsquo;re starting with a good base.** If you walk 30 minutes a day, five days a week, you can build up to a 5k, 10k, or even a half marathon. 
      
      - **Time is on your side.** Start now, and you&rsquo;ll be more than prepared for spring&rsquo;s many event opportunities.

      \r\n\
      - **Ease.** Most slow cooker recipes direct you to add all the ingredients in at once.\r\n\

      - **Savings.** Slow cookers tame cheaper, tougher cuts of meat and bring out the best of their flavor.\r\n\

      Resentment can stymie us mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Whether due to an unkind comment or long-standing feud, smoldering grudges hurt the grudgeholder more than the grudgee. Try these tips to help drop the heavy rock of unforgiveness:
      
      - **Realize you can&rsquo;t change the past.** Revisiting the moments that sparked resentment only gives your negative emotions new life. Practice acceptance and focus on something positive that brings you happiness.
      
      - **Know that you have control over your behavior.** You can&rsquo;t control what anyone else does, but only you can decide how you react and what you put your energy into.
      
      - **Think of forgiveness as a gift to yourself.** Choosing to forgive someone doesn&rsquo;t let them off the hook for their wrongdoing, but it allows you to wash your hands of the situation and minimize the impact of stress and tension on you.
      
      Letting go of resentments leads to emotional freedom and a happier, healthier you.

      Your four basic taste receptors &mdash; sweet, salty, bitter, and sour &mdash; have another sibling. Often referred to as the fifth taste, [umami][1] has been described as meaty or savory, lending many dishes a subtle, pleasant flavor without the [assistance of salt][2]. Add low-sodium versions of these umami-rich accompaniments to your meals and leave the shaker in the cupboard:
      
      - **Parmesan cheese.** Sprinkled over pastas, salads, and soups, parmesan is rich in glutamate, the chief amino acid responsible for umami flavor. 
      
      - **Ketchup.** Roasted tomatoes are high in umami, which explains the popularity of this ubiquitous condiment. Be stingy, though &mdash; it&rsquo;s also high in sugar and salt.
      
      - **Soy sauce.** Made from fermented soybeans, this Asian flavoring adds a salty tang to noodles, rice, and eggs.  Go easy because it&rsquo;s also high in sodium.
      
      Other foods with natural umami goodness include shiitake mushrooms, sweet potatoes, tuna, and carrots for savory, salt-free goodness.

      The word squash comes from the Native American word askutasquash, meaning &ldquo;eaten raw or uncooked.&rdquo; Yet its flavors deepen with cooking &mdash; when it&rsquo;s also much easier to chew. Hard-shell types such as butternut, delicata, and acorn are a treasure trove of vitamin A, potassium, and vitamin C. To access a wealth of nutrients, try these cooking methods:
      
      - **Braised.** After a quick pan browning, simmer squash cubes in broth. Add pasta for a tasty [one-pot meal][1].
      
      - **Steamed.** Thin-skinned delicata squash doesn&rsquo;t require peeling. The long golden beauties with green stripes can be sliced and steamed. Make delicata the star of a [winter salad][2].
      
      - **Roasted.** The oven&rsquo;s high heat reveals this sturdy vegetable&rsquo;s natural sweetness. Prepare a pan of diced squash (add [other root veggies][3] too) at 450 degrees for a fridge stockpile you can use all week in lunches and soups.  
      
      Find your way with squash and you&rsquo;ll discover a smash hit.

      Eating one cup of beans a day has [been shown][1] to help lower blood pressure (to know your vital numbers, take a biometric [health screening][2]). Try these tips to bump up your bean count:
      
      - **Supercharge chili.** Raise the bean-to-meat ratio in your favorite chili recipe. Pinto and black beans add color mixed with kidney beans, or go all veggie. 
      
      - **Lean on lentils.** Instead of rice or pasta for a go-to side dish, try these little legumes. Most lentils cook in half an hour and make a [delicious Indian dal][3].
      
      - **Grab garbanzos.** Tossed with olive oil and dry spices, chickpeas can be oven-roasted for a snack. Add garlic powder or go spicy with cumin and cayenne. 
      
      Remember to opt for lower-sodium varieties and rinse beans before using. Stock your pantry with these humble yet powerful health partners.

      - **Better than butter.** Mashed and spread on whole grain toast, avocado makes a filling and portable energy booster.\r\n\

      As winter approaches, look to your local indoor pool as your cold weather backup plan. Water exercise is low impact yet aerobic &mdash; especially helpful to those with joint issues or low back pain. Among its [many benefits][1], water&rsquo;s buoyancy supports your body so you can move more easily; at the same time it provides resistance that helps build muscle with every movement. Give these water workouts a whirl:
      
      - **Swim laps.** Many pools have designated lanes, making it easy to jump in and rack up the laps.
      
      - **Pool fitness classes.** Moving with a group is always motivating. Classes provide guidance, energizing music, and cardio conditioning.
      
      - **Aqua jogging.** Get all the benefits of running without stress on your joints.
      
      Find a swim center near you and add a refreshing session to your feel-good fitness routine.

      It&rsquo;s almost time for the feast. When planning your Thanksgiving menu, you&rsquo;ll want to fill your family&rsquo;s plates with feel-good foods. Consider a few substitutions to make this year&rsquo;s feast a delicious, vitamin-rich, heart-smart meal.
      
      - **Freshen up a classic.** Trade the old standby canned soup casserole for flavorful, antioxidant-rich [green beans][1], topped with pan saut&#233;ed onions or crunchy walnuts. 
      
      - **Kick up the color.** Use fresh cranberry sauce instead of gravy to perk up turkey. You&rsquo;ll get a vitamin C boost, plus manganese for healthier skin and bones.
      
      - **Choose the orange spud.** Bake whole sweet potatoes in their skins instead of having mashed white potatoes. The bright tuber contains a strong dose of beta carotene for vision and bone health, plus vitamin C for immune function. 
      
      A festive meal that balances indulgence with vitamin-packed veggies truly celebrates the harvest &mdash; and shows how much you care about your guests.

      \r\n\
      - **Pick a petite plate.** You&rsquo;re likely to pile on less food if you use a smaller plate, according to a Cornell University [study][1]. And remember a [healthy plate][2] contains 1/4 protein, 1/4 grains or starches, 1/2 vegetables. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Skip the dip.** Bypass the creamy, cheesy dips and casseroles or politely decline with a simple, &ldquo;It looks delicious, but I can&rsquo;t eat it.&rdquo; No need to explain further. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Watch the clock.** Food should not be left out at room temperature for more than two hours, and only one hour if it is above 80 degrees &mdash; unless hot food is kept above 140 degrees (in a chafing dish or slow cooker, for example) and cold food is kept 40 degrees or lower (on ice). \r\n\
      \r\n\
      Your stomach will thank you for treating it with care this Thanksgiving.\r\n\

      Whether you have two legs or four, staying on the move is good for you&hellip; even during winter. Before you head out into the elements safeguard your furry companion with these cold weather tips:
      
      - **Assess your pet.** Dogs with thicker, longer-haired coats tolerate cold better than short-haired canines. Being closer to the snow and ice, shorter animals feel the cold much more acutely. Also, animals with health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or kidney disease, may have a harder time regulating their body temperature and coping with temperature extremes.
      
      - **Bundle up.** Shivering pets make lousy walking partners. If your dog seems bothered by the cold, have a dry sweater on hand to provide one more layer of protection. If you&rsquo;re not sure about wardrobe choices, check the Internet or ask your vet for guidance. 
      
      - **Perform a paw-check.** Before heading out, check your dog&rsquo;s paws for cracked or bleeding pads. When you return, clean accumulated snow and ice from between their toes.
      
      Don&rsquo;t let lower temperatures give you both a case of cabin fever. Lace up, leash on, and get outside.

      - **Take a quiet lunch.** Leave your work behind and head to the park with your lunch, even if you just sit in your warm car. Relax to your favorite music, listen to a book, or meditate.
      
      - **Keep a journal.** Describe the day&rsquo;s highs and lows. Write down one goal for the next day that you can accomplish and check it off when it&rsquo;s done. [Recording your thoughts][1] can reduce stress and help you set priorities.
      
      - **Do something frivolous.** Allow yourself a break from all task-related activities and holiday obligations. Browse an antique mall, find a quiet corner in the bookstore, or visit a local museum. 
      
      Taking time to retreat during the holidays can make it easier to find the season&rsquo;s peace and joy.

      Junk food connoisseur or health food nut &mdash; your eating habits probably lie somewhere in between, but usually, with room for improvement. Try these simple tweaks to boost nutrition and recharge your energy:
      
      - **Think five or less.** Before it goes in your cart, check the label. If it has more than five ingredients, keep going. Longer lists generally mean more processing.
      
      - **Do a DIY lunch.** When you control the menu, good nutrition is a sure thing. Put a few bucks in a jar every time you pack, then splurge on a luxury every now and then. [Brown bag assistance][1] is at your fingertips.

      Successful relationships include a mixture of commitment and spontaneity. If you and your workout are hoping to be long term, a little fun can be the glue that ensures lasting harmony. Try these tips for enduring fitness bliss:
      
      - **Reward yourself.** Promise yourself a treat when you&rsquo;ve completed a set number of workouts or walked 30 minutes a day, five days a week for a month&hellip; new workout gear, a spa day, or concert tickets. Put a big, red circle around the day you&rsquo;ll award yourself for a mission accomplished.
      
      - **Reverse your workout.** Take your normal route in reverse (but not backward) or vary your workout routine. A change of scenery or pace is simple, but effective. 
      
      - **Enlist an app.** Challenge your personal best or enlist friends to join your fitness quest with an app that tracks workout progress and goals. Examples include [KP Walk!][1] or [Every Body Walk][2] to transform fitness into an interactive adventure.

      - **Chia seeds.** An excellent source of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, and protein, this ancient Aztec staple delivers. Sprinkle these tiny powerhouses on salads, cereals, and juice for nutrition bang. 
      
      - **Quinoa.** This little seed with the funny name (pronounced KEEN-wah) contains all nine amino acids, plus fiber and iron. [Try a few ideas][1] to put its nutty goodness to work.
      
      - **Flax seeds.** Similar to its chia seed brethren, flax seeds are a good source of omega-3s, fiber, and protein.

      Feeling overwhelmed by to-do lists this time of year often prompts a mad dash to the mall or the gift card stand for something &mdash; anything &mdash; to present to friends and loved ones. Giving something from the heart, however, can elevate the gift-giving ritual from slapdash to sublime. [Studies][1] even show that giving is good for you. Keep these strategies in mind:
      
      - **Look for clues.** Watch and listen with new eyes and ears. Does she love scarves? Is he a gadget buff? Normal conversations are often rife with hints: a comment on chocolate or a wish to buy something. 
      
      - **Ask around.** If you&rsquo;re stumped, play detective and ask their best friend or a family member for help. Scan social media for likes, dislikes, posts, and pins.
      
      - **Do some dirty work.** Tackling a distasteful job for someone else can be the ultimate display of love and kindness. Organize a basement. Tackle a stack of papers waiting to be filed. Run an errand.
      
      Gifts from the heart put smiles on the faces of both giver and receiver.

      For many of us, our taste buds are conditioned to receive sweet treats regularly, and [science][1] backs the claim that the overwhelming urge to splurge can be powerful. The occasional indulgence has a role in a healthy diet, but when it comes to the sweet stuff, natural is better. Incorporate these preventive strategies to show processed sugar the door:
      
      - **Eat fruit with your meal.** Indulge your taste buds during the main course and that cake with inch-high frosting will be easier to resist at dessert time. Add cranberry jam to your turkey sandwich. Toss raisins into your rice. Top grilled chicken with mango salsa. Use your imagination.
      
      - **Dilute your drinks.** Substitute half of your juice with seltzer water or club soda. You&rsquo;ll still have fresh flavor but with half the calories. Or better yet, switch to water with a slice of cucumber or citrus.
      
      - **Reduce simple carbs.** Simple carbs &mdash; such as in white pasta, white bread, candy, soda &mdash; rapidly turn into sugar in your body. These culprits give you a quick burst of energy that flames out quickly, triggering the crave cycle once again. Opt for foods with complex carbs instead, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
      
      Simple dietary tweaks can make liberating yourself from too much processed sugar much easier. And emerging victorious will be sweeter.

      Plummeting temperatures, dimming skies, and unfriendly elements may challenge your regular walking routines. But no need to let winter sideline your fitness goals. Stay safe with these seasonal strategies:
      
      - **Gain traction.** Good hiking boots have lug soles with rough treads that help you keep your grip on slippery surfaces. Slip-on traction covers are good for regular walking shoes if you&rsquo;re walking on dry, but snowy, surfaces.
      
      - **Light up, safety first.** Shorter days leave less time for daylight walks. Reflective vests and safety lights are a must. Also, make sure you let someone know where you&rsquo;re going and when you&rsquo;ll be back if venturing out for an evening walk.
      
      - **Use sun protection.** Sunscreen, lip balm, and sunglasses aren&rsquo;t just for summer. You can still get a sunburn in the winter, and glare from snow and ice can be blinding.
      
      Stay true to your walk &mdash; 30 minutes a day, five days a week &mdash; no matter the season.

      You may know scores of people, but you can probably count your true friends on one hand. Genuine friendships are rare, spectacular, and worth your attention. What qualities make a true friend? 
      
      - **They encourage you to accept yourself.** This doesn&rsquo;t mean they endorse behavior that&rsquo;s less than commendable. Rather, a genuine friend helps you realize unique qualities are great because they&rsquo;re yours.
      
      - **They call you out.** Real friends point out your flaws not to be spiteful, but to help you be a better person. They&rsquo;re on your side no matter what.
      
      - **They listen.** When called upon for listening duty, true friends pay attention to what you&rsquo;re saying and stay on topic, rather than turn the conversation back to themselves.
      
      - **They forgive.** Genuine friendships are able to weather the storms of conflict that are bound to crop up between erring humans. Letting inevitable slights and irritations go is an important part of healing in every relationship.
      
      Being a true friend takes work and time, but the [happiness][1] found in authentic companionship is immeasurable.

      As you plan holiday menus, keep in mind that upgrading nutrition for traditional dishes doesn&rsquo;t mean downgrading flavor. Try these savory substitutions at the next get-together:
      
      - **Roasted sweet potatoes for candied yams.** Typically loaded with sugary syrup and marshmallows, these colorful root vegetables have long been abused. Instead, [try a recipe][1] with flavorings that let their natural sweetness shine.   
      
      - **Hot chai for eggnog.** The aroma of spicy goodness wafting from your kitchen may help you forget about that traditional glass of saturated fat and calories known as eggnog. Just go skinny on the chai, using half the sugar and skim milk.
      
      - **Whole grains rather than processed.** Moving your family away from the white stuff takes time. Be patient. [Try a recipe][2] that has a mix of whole wheat and white flours. Use the same half-and-half ratio with your stuffing recipe.
      
      Forge boldly into healthy culinary territory and let the deliciousness speak for itself.

      - **Ice-skating:** Even if you live where it&rsquo;s warm, you can still have chilly indoor fun by visiting a rink. [Ice-skating][1] for one hour can burn roughly 510 calories for a 160-pound person. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Sledding:** Riding down a slippery slope doesn&rsquo;t seem like much work. But trekking back up the hill for each go can work your cardio-respiratory system and legs. In fact, [walking in snow][2] burns over 50 percent more calories than walking on pavement. \r\n\
      \r\n\
      - **Cross-country skiing:** You can burn nearly 500 calories/hour skiing on flat terrain. Both a lower- and upper-body workout, cross-country skiing is considered great cardiovascular exercise too. But if the white powder hasn&rsquo;t fallen yet, jump on an elliptical or cross-country machine for similar benefits.\r\n\
      \r\n\
      Don&rsquo;t forget about classic cold-weather activities to keep you moving.\r\n\

      There&rsquo;s no reason to miss out on the health benefits of whole grains. Many &mdash; such as quinoa, brown rice, and teff &mdash; are even gluten free. Besides containing nutritious fiber and helping lower cholesterol, whole grains can also:
      
      - **Reduce your spare tire.** [Studies][1] show that eating more whole grains may be associated with less belly fat.
      
      - **Regulate blood sugar.** Eating whole grains helps keep your glucose from spiking, lowering your risk for type 2 diabetes. In [one study][2], participants who ate two to three daily servings of whole grains had a 30 percent lower risk of type 2 diabetes.
      
      - **Provide a good source of vitamins and minerals.** Most whole grains are rich in B vitamins, such as thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin, as well as a good source of iron, magnesium, selenium, and zinc.
      
      The next time you shop, check labels for the whole grain stamp &mdash; which means at least half a serving of whole grains inside.

      Don&rsquo;t let snow mothball your walking routine. When the white stuff threatens to soak your socks, try your hand at the ancient practice of snowshoeing. Snowshoeing takes minimal training and offers maximum fun. Here&rsquo;s why to try it:
      
      - **It&rsquo;s a great workout.** Snowshoeing offers low-impact, aerobic exercise that burns more calories than walking or running at the same speed. Hips get a great workout, thanks to a wider stance needed to accommodate the snowshoes&rsquo; width.
      
      - **It&rsquo;s easy.** If you can walk, you can snowshoe. It doesn&rsquo;t take long to learn the required techniques, such as traversing slopes and going up and down hills. 
      
      - **It&rsquo;s inexpensive.** Snowshoes and poles are the only special gear you&rsquo;ll need for the sport. No lift ticket necessary.
      
      - **It&rsquo;s outside.** Nothing invigorates quite so much as bracing winter air and sparkling snowscapes. [Studies][1] show that compared to exercising indoors, outdoor exercise is associated with greater feelings of revitalization, reduced tension and depression, and increased energy. 
      
      Rent some snowshoes and give it a try.

      Adopting a habit of conscious gratitude is the [key to happiness][1], regardless of your circumstances. Take these steps to learn the art of gratitude:
      
      - **Be thankful.** Write down the things you have&hellip; some you might even take for granted, such as food, shelter, your family, and friends. 
      
      - **Look for simple things.** A child&rsquo;s laugh. Sunlight glinting on the snow. Chili bubbling on the stove. A warm mug on cold hands. Be present. Savor the small gifts in life.
      
      - **Appreciate everybody.** You&rsquo;re not going to like everybody. But choosing to accept and appreciate them &mdash; as they are &mdash; will help you see more clearly that it&rsquo;s not all about you. A dawdling child &mdash; teaches you patience. That grumpy cashier has just been on her feet all day  give her a warm, understanding smile. 
      
      Like any habit, remembering to be grateful takes practice.

      Don&rsquo;t wait for your next movie night to pop a bowl of popcorn. Done right, this little kernel can be the perfect snack. Here&rsquo;s why:
      
      - **It&rsquo;s loaded with antioxidants.** [Research][1] shows that popcorn contains high amounts of polyphenols, excellent antioxidants that have been discovered to fight cell-damaging free radicals, which may play a role in causing cancer.
      
      - **It&rsquo;s a whole grain.** And therefore, a good source of heart-healthy fiber. Half of the grains that you eat should be whole grains. Find out how many servings of grains are [right for you][2]. Three cups of popped popcorn equal one serving of grains.
      
      - **It&rsquo;s inexpensive.** Just don&rsquo;t let the movie theater make it for you. Movie theater popcorn is generally loaded with calories, sodium, and saturated fat, not to mention expensive. 
      
      Skip the chemical-coated microwave version. Invest in an air popper and experiment with [different toppings][3].

      Warmer months boast flora, fauna, and chaotic color, but this time of year offers a quiet peace &mdash; a cool meditation that lasts for weeks. On your next walk, pay attention to these subtle graces of winter: 
      
      - **The stillness.** Crickets are hiding, birdsongs are subdued, and most people are warm inside. With such solitude, a winter walk easily transforms into a contemplative sojourn. 
      
      - **The stark beauty.** Bare and often white, the simplicity of sparkling, smooth winterscapes is easy on the eyes.
      
      - **The bracing chill.** Inflate your lungs with invigorating winter air, crisp and cold. Flushed cheeks, dewy sweat, and a quickening heart are signs of an exhilarating aerobic workout.  
      
      Lace up, put on some layers, and embrace the season.

      Effective stomach disciplinarians know how to quell hunger pangs decisively without sabotaging their health. Here are three of their secrets:
      
      - **They&rsquo;re DIY snackers.** No vending machine dashes for these folks. Home-packed snacks &mdash; such as fruit, cut vegetables, and whole grain crackers &mdash; deliver both nutrition and savings.
      
      - **They give [good fats][1] their due.** Foods containing unsaturated fats &mdash; such as almonds, walnuts, pecans, and avocados &mdash; help us feel satisfied and comfortable until the next meal. They may also improve blood cholesterol levels and reduce inflammation. 
      
      - **They drink lots of water.** Sipping water throughout the day can help keep you feeling full. Not getting enough can also make you feel fatigued, which is one of the first signs of dehydration. Instead of reaching for something to chew on to boost energy, you may only need your liquids replenished. 
      
      Winning at the snacking game is about playing offensively. Be prepared and victory is surely yours.

      Having a long-term workout plan is the perfect strategy for achieving fitness goals. But you don&rsquo;t have to wait months to see the benefits. Consider these instant results of daily physical activity:
      
      - **Improved mood.** [Studies][1] find that nearly all exercise &mdash; walking, lifting weights, even gardening &mdash; can lift depression and reduce stress. Whether it&rsquo;s the endorphins coursing through your body, the sense of accomplishment for a workout well done, or the people you socialize with at the gym, regular exercise buoys the spirit.
      
      - **Revved up metabolism.** Right away, your elevated heart rate signals to your brain that something important is happening, and boom! Your metabolic furnace is cranking away, torching calories. Varying the intensity and duration of your workouts boosts your metabolism even more.
      
      - **Better sleep.** When it comes to good quality winks, workouts are the [best sleep medicine][2]. People who exercise fall asleep faster, enjoy deeper slumber, and awake less often. 
      
      You&rsquo;re designed to move. Treat your body to a workout and start reaping the benefits today.

      Wondering what happened to your morning zeal when afternoon rolls around? The secret to a slump-free day often starts at the breakfast table. Kick start your day with nutritious foods that supply steady energy long past lunchtime.
      
      - **Complex carbs.** High-sugar, processed foods &mdash; such as white bread and pastries &mdash; don&rsquo;t provide lasting energy. Instead choose whole grain toast or waffles. Or enjoy a warm bowl of oatmeal or quinoa with nuts and fruit. 
      
      - **Fruit.** Besides being loaded with vitamins and minerals, fruit can help fight [mental fatigue][1] by keeping you hydrated. Have a bowl of portable citrus and bananas on hand for an easy, naturally packaged snack. 
      
      - **Lean proteins.** Foods rich in protein [are shown][2] to stimulate wakefulness and provide more energy than carb-heavy foods. Try an egg scrambled with cooked, crumbled turkey sausage or low-fat yogurt sprinkled with a handful of nuts.
      
      With a few dietary tweaks, that afternoon energy flatline could be history.
